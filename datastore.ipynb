All TFNA contributions are ODA eligible. The TFNA funds all DCAF activities in Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. The TFNA ensures greater donor coordination, which is key to success when supporting local security sector reform processes. Through the TFNA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Steering Committee, Member States provide oversight and strategic guidance on DCAF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work to support security sector development and reform in the region. The current TFNA members are Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Contributing donors can opt to contribute to either the North Africa window, or to one or several of the four country windows, or to both the regional and the country windows. Beyond this option, the Fund however does not accept any other form of earmarking.</narrative>\\n  </description>\\n  <description type=\"4\">\\n    <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">In 2011, an outburst of Arab popular discontent placed the various national security organizations and their practices in the spotlight. Ever since, reform of the police, security forces, the defence forces and the intelligence organizations has become key to ensuring stability, human rights and democratic transition. Several countries in North Africa realize that restoring public trust in the state requires restoring trust in those state institutions, which have the responsibility to protect the citizens. Some countries in the region realize that making security and justice organisations more transparent, accountable, and respectful of human dignity, helps reduce popular grievances, and hence violence and extremism.</narrative>\\n  </description>\\n  <participating-org type=\"10\" role=\"1\">\\n    <narrative>Germany - Federal Foreign Office</narrative>\\n  </participating-org>\\n  <participating-org ref=\"CH-4\" type=\"10\" role=\"1\">\\n    <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">Switzerland - Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC)</narrative>\\n  </participating-org>\\n  <participating-org ref=\"CH-FDJP-109458452\" type=\"60\" role=\"2\" activity-id=\"CH-FDJP-109458452-Grant4000003634\">\\n    <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)</narrative>\\n  </participating-org>\\n  <participating-org ref=\"CH-FDJP-109458452\" type=\"60\" role=\"4\" activity-id=\"CH-FDJP-109458452-Trust-Fund-for-North-Africa\">\\n    <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)</narrative>\\n  </participating-org>\\n  <participating-org type=\"10\" role=\"1\">\\n    <narrative>Belgium - Federal Public Service Foreign Affairs - Federal Police</narrative>\\n  </participating-org>\\n  <participating-org type=\"10\" role=\"1\">\\n    <narrative>Luxembourg - Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs - Directorate of Defence</narrative>\\n  </participating-org>\\n  <participating-org type=\"10\" role=\"1\">\\n    <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">France - Ministry of Foreign Affairs</narrative>\\n  </participating-org>\\n  <participating-org ref=\"CH-FDJP-109458452\" type=\"60\" role=\"1\" activity-id=\"CH-FDJP-109458452-Grant4000003634\">\\n    <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">DCAF - Geneva Centre for Security Sector Governance</narrative>\\n  </participating-org>\\n  <activity-status code=\"2\"/>\\n  <activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2012-06-12\">\\n    <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">DCAF TFNA was established on 12 June 2012.</narrative>\\n  </activity-date>\\n  <contact-info type=\"1\">\\n    <organisation>\\n      <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">DCAF</narrative>\\n    </organisation>\\n    <department>\\n      <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">Operation</narrative>\\n    </department>\\n    <person-name>\\n      <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">Emma Behrens</narrative>\\n    </person-name>\\n    <job-title>\\n      <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">Junior Project Officer - TFNA and Fundraising</narrative>\\n    </job-title>\\n    <telephone>+41227309527</telephone>\\n    <email>e.behrens@dcaf.ch</email>\\n    <website>https://www.dcaf.ch/</website>\\n    <mailing-address>\\n      <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">tfna@dcaf.ch</narrative>\\n    </mailing-address>\\n  </contact-info>\\n  <activity-scope code=\"2\"/>\\n  <recipient-region code=\"189\" percentage=\"100\" vocabulary=\"1\"/>\\n  <sector code=\"15210\" percentage=\"100\" vocabulary=\"1\">\\n    <narrative xml:lang=\"en\">The OECD DAC Guidelines on Security System Reform and Governance agreed by ministers in 2004 define the security system as including: core security actors (e.g. armed forces, police, gendarmerie, border guards, customs and immigration, and intelligence and security services); security management and oversight bodies (e.g. ministries of defence and internal affairs, financial management bodies and public complaints commissions); justice and law enforcement institutions (e.g. the judiciary, prisons, prosecution services, traditional justice systems); and non-statutory security forces (e.g. private security companies, guerrilla armies and private militia).

Specific objectives are:  1.- To improve MIJ\\'s Integrated Information System (LITIGOB), in order to establish a complete, updated and reliable inventory of potential high-impact claims and keep track of claims eligible for ADR mechanisms; 2.- To develop and implement the internal administrative procedures that will allow MIJ to effectively coordinate, monitor and control legal claims management by other Government agencies; and 3.- To design and apply a capacity-building model that allows MIJ to conduct training-of-trainers for lawyers and civil servants involved in the application of the procedures of coordination, monitoring and control of legal claims management. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2006-04-27\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2006-04-27\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-03-27\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-04-04\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Carolina Rendon</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Resident Representative</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>crendon@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"CO\">     <narrative>COLOMBIA</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15113\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Anti-corruption organisations and institutions]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2006-04-27\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2011-03-27\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">478491.39 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">478491.39  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P104385\">\\n       <narrative>COLOMBIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">478491.39  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P104385\">\\n       <narrative>COLOMBIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:35:54\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P104395</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Legal Education Capacity Building Project</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>This IDF will suport the Nigeria Legal Educaiton Council in its efforts to reform its curriculum and teaching methods by introducing new subjects as well as distance learning techniologies.

Some donors (Sweden and USAID) have expressed their commitment to support the demand for information. However, there is a need for providing technical assistance to the Access to information Institute and to support public institutions in upgrading their information management systems so they are able to meet the new demand for information. The present project compliments Bank and other donor initiatives in promoting good governance in Honduras by supporting the implementation of the Transparency law and the establishment of the Access to Information institute  Objectives: 1. Contribute to create a culture of transparency, accountability and democratic governance in Honduras, through the implementation of the Transparency law. 2. Support the creation of the Access to information institute contemplated in the Transparency law and the publication of the information by public institutions as obliged by the law. 3. Support information management systems of key public institutions to ensure they are able to meet the new demand for information. 4. Facilitate broad social participation by enhancing access to information and promoting the use of the Transparency law by citizens, civil society organizations, media and private sector to demand accountability of public institutions and ensure these become more responsive to citizens\\' needs. Grant Components Component 1: Establishment of the Institute to access information  ($ 80,460) This component will provide support to the establishment of the oversight body responsible for the promotion and enforcement of the Access to Public Information Law so it can fulfill its mandate.

The Government of Brazil recognizes this need and has been working to strengthen its M&amp;E systems at the federal level in order to improve the quality of decision making and resource allocation. The GoB has requested World Bank assistance to strengthen its capacity for the design of an integrated, results-based M&amp; E system. The grant will support the following activites: a) development of a collective vision for making M&amp;E more effective in Brazil; b) institutional assessments of M&amp; E systems in selected line ministries; c) capacity building of M&amp;E units; and d) capacity building in impact evaluation methodology. Sound monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of programs and policies at the country level is critical to demonstrate progress in achieving outcomes and impact. The Government of Brazil recognizes this need, and has been working to strengthen its country systems for M&amp;E at the federal level in order to improve the quality of decision making and resource allocation; however, institutional challenges remain.  In Brazil, the responsibilities for Monitoring and Evaluation are dispersed amongst several actors, and a high degree of interministerial cooperation is necessary to make the system function. Central to moving forward the M&amp;E agenda are actors from both the executive and legislative branches of government, which include: (a) the Ministry of Planning (MoP) and the Technical Committee for M&amp;E (CTMA), which supports the Inter-Ministerial Commission for M&amp;E (CMA ) charged with developing government- wide M&amp;E norms and policies; (b) the Federal Court of Accounts (Tribunal das Contas da Uniao, TCU) associated with the legislative branch of government; (c) the Secretariat of Monitoring and Articulation (Casa Civil) directly linked to the presidency; and (d) specific line ministries (e.g., Ministry for Social Development and Combating Hunger).  In this context, the Government of Brazil (GOB) has requested World Bank support to strengthen its capacity for the design and building of an integrated results-based M&amp;E system. The GOB has requested that the grant support the Federal Court of Accounts (Tribunal das Contas da Uniao, TCU) associated with the legislative branch of government legislative (TCU) branch. The activities to be supported by the grant (outlined in greater detail below) would encompass the capacity building of TCU in Impact Evaluation (IE) methodology. These tasks would lay the foundation for the design of an improved results-based M&amp;E system, with an emphasis on building a coherent strategy that links performance measurement to budget and line making decision-making, thus promoting accountability, efficiency, efficacy, and effectiveness of government policies and programs. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-03-26\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-03-26\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-09-26\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-08-26\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Tarsila Ortenzio Velloso</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Public Sector Mgmt.

The federal-state commissions (CPFF in particular) have already broken significant ground but challenges remain. Tackling these challenges, combined with the country\\'s state credit rating system,  could place Mexico at the forefront of subnational fiscal transparency.  The federal Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP), through its departments of Coordination of Federal Entities (UCEF) and Government Accounting (UCGIP), has an important convening role in the accounting harmonization process.  On a technical level, however, while in some cases it may be best for states to follow federal government practices, in many areas the federal government should also consider following the lead of particular states. A complementary approach combining \"top down\" general rules with \"bottom up\" specifics and systems, all anchored in a federal-state partnership, is likely to yield better results through ownership and knowledge sharing. Through its careful work over the last two years, the Bank has earned a place as a trusted facilitator of such partnerships, which has lead to the government\\'s request for this IDF grant. Recognizing the potential economies of scale inherent to development of adaptable common tools to address similar problems, the support strategy is to contribute to the \"bottom up\" processes mentioned above, particularly through the direct support to a program designed by the State of Aguascalientes, a credible and leading voice among states on budgetary and accounting harmonization.  The tools developed with IDF support would be shared with other states and the federal government, with the aim at documenting lessons learned and facilitating replication. This approached has been endorsed by the SHCP. The grant would have two specific objectives: (i) to build capacity in the State of Aguascalientes to develop harmonized budgetary and accounting systems capable of producing timely and reliable fiscal information in accordance with suitable standards; and (ii) to continue supporting state-federal partnerships for discussion and knowledge sharing, in the context of the national fiscal coordination system (SNCF). The grant proposal is largely based on the Budgetary and Accounting Harmonization Program of the State of Aguascalientes, and takes into consideration discussions with the relevant departments from the federal Secretariat of Finance (UCEF and UCGIP). Such initiative attests to strong country ownership and commitment. Moreover, as noted earlier, the incoming federal administration intends to pay attention to fiscal transparency and accountability at the three levels of government.

It would include procedures and standards for the conduct of such audits.   IDF support would be used to cover the cost of engaging international and local Consultants to develop and prepare the Guidelines as well as the cost of setting and preparations for the printing of the manuals.  The grant will also support the testing of the use of the manuals by carrying out limited audits of two Special Funds and one procurement audit for a major Ministry as well as one Forensic audit of a problem but critical Ministry. 2    Development of Website for GAS and the establishment of an    ICT based Resource Centre (Online Digital Media Library) Under this component, a Website would be developed for GAS, to enable it place copies of its annual report on the Web.   The general public would then be able to access the Auditor-General\\'s annual report to Parliament on the Internet.   This is critical if the public is to have more confidence in the functions of the Auditor-General.  Other general information about GAS would also be available on the Web.    IDF grant support would be used to 1) hire a Consultant to create the Website, 2) purchase one computer and accessories to be used for the development of the Website  3) the cost of training 3 officers to maintain the Website.  4) the cost of initial Internet connections that will make the website operational. The component will also support the setting up of a Modern Digital Resource Centre for the Audit Service.  GAS is seeking support from the office of the Auditor-General of South African to assist her undertake this assignment. Should this come through part of the grant will be used to finance the cost of travel and expenses of such officers who may come to Ghana. Should this arrangement delay, then international support will be competitively sort to enable GAS undertake this assignment. The grant will therefore finance 1) the cost of consultancy for the design of the Resource Centre.        2) the cost of initial equipment for the setting up of the infrastructure for the Resource Centre such as online digital equipments that will facilitate the retrieval of documents and information. GAS will renovate and refurbish the facilities that will host the sensitive equipment    3) the cost of 3 officers at the Centre undertaking a Study Tour to a similar and well functioning Resource Centre such as that of the South African Auditor-General\\'s Office.  4) the cost of training officers to manage and update the Resource Centre. To strengthen the capacity of the Ghana Audit Service to carry out specialized audits in the  areas of Public Procurement, Special Funds and Forensics.   Presently, the Audit Service does not have capacity to carry out its functions effectively and  expeditiously in the areas of Public Procurement, Special Funds and Forensics. This project will provide critical funding and technical support for the Audit Service to enable it to acquire the needed skills to carry out audits in these new areas. Over the past years the government has set  up a number of statutory funds or Special Funds. These are financed through special Legislative  Acts and the general public is unhappy about how these funds are being managed. The Audit Service has not developed guidelines and manuals to guide the conduct of audits in this area.  GAS therefore requires capacity building to increase its specialized knowledge and skills in  conducting Procurement and Forensic audits as well as Special Funds audit and the preparation of reports for such audits. The project will support the Audit Service to meet its reporting obligations under the  Constitution of the country. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2007-08-15\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2007-08-15\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2010-12-15\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-02-01\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Robert Wallace DeGraft-Hanson</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Financial Management Specialist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>rdegrafthanson@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"GH\">     <narrative>GHANA</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"24010\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Financial policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2007-08-15\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2010-12-15\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">244336.20 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">244336.20  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P104416\">\\n       <narrative>GHANA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">244336.20  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P104416\">\\n       <narrative>GHANA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:36:27\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P104428</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Strengthening PRSP Monitoring and Evaluation Framework</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>The main purpose of the project is to create an in country M&amp;E capacity and to strengthen the PRSP M&amp;E framework, by making it more result focused. Therefore the grant will be funding training sessions intended to provide a Leadership team composed of staffs from public administrations playing a pivotal role in the PRSP implementation monitoring and evaluation with basic knowledge in result oriented monitoring and evaluation and especially in the PRSP M&amp;E framework design and implementation. Once trained, the team members are also supposed to be training other staff members involved in the PRSP M&amp;E. The project will also contribute in mainstreaming knowledge transfers between International Consulting firms specialized in M&amp;E and Local consulting firms which will be acting as the first one assistant during the project implementation.  As regard to Mali PRSP M&amp;E framework strengthening, the project will provide support to the PRSP coordinating unit when addressing its current weakness as recommended by the Government when approving Mali PRSP2 commonly named Poverty Reduction and Growth strategy Paper (PRGSP 2007-2011) in December 2006. As a result, the grant will fund the development of a Pilot Results Matrix aiming at translated part of the PRGSP Policy Matrix into a comprehensive M&amp;E framework capable of providing decision makers with relevant standardized reports on the PRGSP implementation progress toward its final outcomes achievement. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2007-10-10\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2007-10-10\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-04-10\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2013-06-18\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Fily Bouare Sissoko</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Operations Officer</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"ML\">     <narrative>MALI</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public sector policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2007-10-10\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-04-10\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">168875.32 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">168875.32  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P104428\">\\n       <narrative>MALI</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">168875.32  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P104428\">\\n       <narrative>MALI</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:36:32\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P104445</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Legal and Judicial reforms to Strengthen Creditor Rights</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>The proposed grant has two components - (i) Strengthening judicial delivery in commercial and banking cases by establishing a new commercial court, and (ii) obtaining baseleine data on Judiciary.  (i) Nepal has recently passed a set of legislations (such as the Insolvency Ordinance) vesting jurisdiction in a yet to be established Commercial Court. These matters are presently being taken to the general courts, whose functioning leaves a lot to be desired. In absence of continuing training being provided to judges (see below), judges get insufficient exposure to commercial practices. There is no awareness of the opportunity cost when productive assets get blocked in the courts. An all new Commercial Court looks an attractive alternative, but may possibly be unproductive as an independent entity. Another way of achieving this may be through a dedicated Commercial Bench at the Appellate and Supreme Court level. This sub-component of the grant will finance the (i) setting up of the Commercial Bench, the procedures, manual, case management system, (ii) an assessment of training needs and development of modules which can be used to train the judges and support staff. (iii) study of existing model of division of jurisdictions and performance of institutions. (ii) Lengthy court proceedings are perhaps the most visible symptom of the crisis in the Nepali judiciary. They translate into significant and perpetual backlogs - a breeding ground for petty corruption. There have been many initiatives to tackle this problem.  Most of them have focused at case management in the narrow sense of processing papers and reorganizing and/or automating some of the business operations. More is needed to sustain increase court productivity and reduce both time and costs of court operations.  Such reforms should certainly include consolidation of court jurisdiction and competence so the cases are decided with less cost without compromising quality.  The reform should expand to include the distribution of cases among the courts to allocation of cases to judges.  Judicial Map (geographical organization of the courts) seems also to contribute to lower performance of the courts, as large number of the courts necessarily impede specialization and lead to difficult and costly supervision. Although civil procedures in Nepal does not seem to be terribly formal (28 steps comparing to 29.7 regional average) they are in need of improvement.  Endless opportunities for appeals seem to be a big problem which, in addition to increasing delay and costs, raises opportunities for corruption.  To formulate the foregoing reforms it is necessary to have the necessary data and information on the judiciary. This subcomponent of the grant will finance the -(i) the collection of baseline data, including public perception of judiciary (ii) judicial mapping (iii) assessment of judges performance The objective of the Project is to build capacity of the judiciary in providing dispute resolution services in banking and commercial matters through commercial bench and data collection and analysis. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2007-08-22\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2007-08-22\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2010-12-22\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-01-03\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Lubomira Zimanova Beardsley</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Counsel</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"NP\">     <narrative>NEPAL</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15130\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"50.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Legal and judicial development]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector> <sector code=\"24010\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"50.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Financial policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2007-08-22\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2010-12-22\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">340612.48 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">340612.48  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P104445\">\\n       <narrative>NEPAL</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">340612.48  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P104445\">\\n       <narrative>NEPAL</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:36:37\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P104465</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Caribbean Emergency Legislation</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative> .The proposed project will assess current legal frameworks in the Caribbean with a goal of improving the legislative and administrative framework triggered in a state of emergency.

The collection of case studies from different parts of the country will aid this task. The IDF will provide an opportunity for the government to assess the success of existing policy instruments and to review international best practice. It will also enable the government to analyze the degree to which the right skills and attitudes in place at all levels to respond to existing and future public health challenges.  By supporting the government to assess skills gaps and to develop recommendations and new policy instruments in three important areas ( health insurance, preventive health and health workforce), the IDF should help to build MOH#s capacity as a health sector # steward#. There are three components: Component 1: Finding a sustainable path to Universal Health Insurance (UHI) One of MOH\\'s CPHFs is to ensure equity through sustainable health financing mechanisms.  As indicated, the government has set out targets to universalize health insurance by 2010. This is a highly ambitious task which requires the exploration of existing roles and policies; analysis of skills gaps and development of a workable action plan and new policy instruments. This component aims to build capacity of MOH, specifically the Department of Health Insurance. It will be necessary for MOH to work with other relevant departments e.g. MOLISA in the analysis. Technical assistance will be provided to help the government assess two key policy instruments and to develop and disseminate recommendations. The assessments will collect case studies from around the country and review best practice from overseas. Recommendations for addressing skills gaps and new policy instruments will be developed and discussed through workshops. The end result should be that MOH is better placed to achieve UHI. Component 2: Goals and priorities in preventive health  and investigating other core public health functions Another of the government\\'s CPHFs is to address preventive health challenges in communicable and non-communicable diseases. Funding and TA will help build capacity in the Department of Preventive Health to undertake this CPHF. This component will provide assistance to the MOH to assess the country\\'s preventive health challenges and develop new policy instruments, through analysis of existing policies, development of case studies and experiences from other countries. MOH should undertake the analysis in conjunction with relevant departments such as Food Safety, Road Safety and the Environment. The assessment will draw on lessons learned in dealing with SARS and AI i.e. which policy instruments were effective, and which were not. It will also analyze the challenges of NCDs such as environmental factors, road safety, food safety etc. The assessment will look at existing policies; the role of the central, provincial and district levels of government; the legal framework; organizational structures and functions; co-ordination between relevant ministries; financial and infrastructure conditions; governance and stewardship. Recommendations, including new policy instruments will be discussed and disseminated through workshops. This component will also provide funding and TA to build the government\\'s capacity to assess and develop other CPHFs such as: the impact on health of international trade policy/ WTO; intellectual property rights and health or the role of the private sector in health financing. Component 3: The Health Workforce The third component addresses another CPHF - the maintenance of an effective health workforce. TA and funding aims to build capacity in the departments of Training and Personnel to enable them to develop effective health workforce policies, and to move from a centralized \\'command and control\\' approach to that of a sector \\'steward\\'. Although provinces have more autonomy than before, there is still much to be done to ensure that the health workforce is adequately skilled and effectively dispersed around the country. MOH should undertake analysis with MOET where relevant. The IDF will support the government to undertake an assessment that looks at: HRM policies and procedures; case studies of past HRM successes and challenges in dealing with emerging diseases such as AI and SARS; HRM for NCDs eg. food safety, road safety, environmental hazards etc. ; analysis of current workforce policies and practices including incentives and motivation, financing and budgeting and training; analysis of current workforce picture (using standard categories e.g. educational background, age, job category and level of specialization, location); identification of changes and shortfalls over last 10 years; summary of capacity constraints; analysis of job satisfaction of medical practitioners; relevance of workforce abilities to needs of users and levels of health workers\\' knowledge of proposed reforms and implications. The assessment will examine key policy instruments and skills gaps and will set out recommendations and new policy instruments.  Recommendations will be discussed in workshops. To help the MOH by building its stewardship capcities pertaining to Core Public Health Functions, including: health insurance, preventive health, and health workforce. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"GB-GOV-1\" type=\"10\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>UK -

More specifically, the grant will support the Governments\\' efforts to develop and sustain the institutional capacity in financial management, procurement and project management to enable the countries to effectively implement capital projects in support of their development agenda.  Objectives &amp; Expected Outcomes.  The grant will enhance the capacity of key ministries and departments within the public sector, involved in capital project implementation, in the critical areas of project management and fiduciary areas. The quality and pace of projects are expected to improve, thereby leading to greater development impact. In addition, transaction costs are expected to decrease substantially for both the authorities and donors. Proposed activities: The IDF grant would provide financing for technical assistance to assist the Governments of the OECS sub-region in implementing specific action plans to build institutional capacity in the key areas discussed above.  Specifically, the components to be finance by the proposed grant include: o   Component One:  Project Management Capacity Building The weaknesses in the fiduciary area are symptomatic of much broader project management issues relating to formulation of the countries\\' development strategy, the quality of project planning to implement the strategy, the design of project components, and the quality of project implementation. This component will therefore focus on building project management capacity within the public sector for project planning, design and implementation. A review of existing country systems for project management will be followed by the development and implementation of a country-specific Action Plan for this area.   This might include upgrading of existing systems, training of personnel, and the realignment of management processes. The activities under this component will contribute to the strengthening of the Public Sector Investment Program process. o   Component Two: Financial Management Capacity Building All of the countries in the OECS have experienced challenges in the timely preparation, delivery and review of good quality financial information - a critical component of the monitoring and evaluation of the projects\\' performance. To strengthen the institutional capacity of the supreme audit institutions (SAIs), individual country action plans, based on the analysis of the existing needs, will be prepared. They will focus on such areas as audit methodology development and implementation; personnel training and professional development. Following the implementation of proposed actions, further support will be provided to the SAIs, while applying on practice newly developed tools and skills. Participating SAIs will be paired with the peer institutions and/or reputable private audit firms and provided with ad-hoc consultant support and assistance. Extending the scope of the SAIs\\' involvement in audits and reviews of the government and donor-financed projects will enhance government accountability, decrease transaction costs and facilitate the movement towards country systems. o   Component Three:  Procurement Capacity Building Limited procurement capacity has had a detrimental effect on the preparedness and subsequent implementation of projects across the OECS.  Failure to properly plan procurement activities, including inappropriate qualification and evaluation criteria, limited capacity for contract administration, and late payments to suppliers and contractors are some of the pervasive characteristics of this function. The existing legal frameworks for procurement in most of the OECS countries are also outdated, but are currently being considered for review. Regulatory and institution strengthening would comprise: (i) a review of the procurement Acts to reflect best-practice as well as anti-corruption measures; (ii) training of government staff in procurement; (iii) the establishment of a monitoring system to track contract awards and to deal with complaints and other procurement-related issues; and (iv) the establishment of a one-stop virtual sub-regional procurement database. o   Component Four: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation Given the regional nature of the proposed Grant it should be executed by one of the regional institution with the appropriate comparative advantage and inter-island learning should be fully exploited.  Under this component, a mid-term forum--to monitor progress and share best practices and lessons learned--would be convened among the various stakeholders involved in the implementation of the Grant. In addition, using existing arrangements, a monitoring committee would be established under the auspices of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank.  It would comprise the six Financial Secretaries/Permanent Secretaries of Finance from each OECS country and would draw upon outside expertise in the areas of project management, financial management and procurement. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-04-08\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-04-08\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-06-19\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-07-20\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Maritza A.

Four activities: 1.1 Provision of technical support to project partners - through use of NFI staff and consultants a NFI\\'s technical support program for South Asia will be developed, 1.2 Provision of training of trainers courses - enhancing the capacity of local organizations and individuals to provide their own training programs, 1.3 Provision of information technology to support technical support activities - enhancing NFI\\'s resource base to meet the increasing demands for technical support. Component 2: Developing  knowledge management capacity: This component will allow NFI to implement a three-year knowledge management plan that will improve the flow of information to partner organizations and strengthen NFI\\'s role as a leading regional and international source of information on HIV/AIDS and the sexual and reproductive health of MSM, by three linked activities: 2.1 Provision of knowledge management support to NFI - To hire knowledge management consultants to build the capacity of NFI and its partners to implement a knowledge management plan, and 2.2 Upgrading information technology for knowledge management - provision of information technology to support implementation of knowledge management plan. Component 3: Developing advocacy capacity: To build NFI\\'s advocacy capacity and that of partnering local organizations: 3.1 Provision of advocacy technical assistance - hiring of a advocacy consultant to develop NFI\\'s advocacy program internally, and externally with a range of key stakeholders in South Asia, and to build the capacity of NFI and its partners to implement this program 3.2 Provision of advocacy outreach support - visiting four key influence groups per year, including travel and per diem costs, 3.3 Provision of national advocacy meetings, and 3.4 Provision of capital equipment for advocacy activities - providing capital equipment support to enhance advocacy activities. The Grant will not finance any activities  which are directly political in nature. Component 4: Strengthening financing and management capacity: Critical for their survival, the NGOs have to build capacity for sustained fundraising and finance management with a medium-term view. This 4th component enhances the capacity of NFI and partner organizations to finance their activities and for the development of appropriate other management systems for its sustained development. Four activities: 4.1 Developing financing capacity - by employing financing consultants to implement and develop a financing strategy which includes securing resources for NFI and its partner organizations, and improving the capacity of partner organizations to write proposals and seek funding themselves, 4.2 Financing outreach - providing support to visit foundations to negotiate funding, 4.3 Supporting management capacity development - by employing consultants to review, amend and organizational plans and systems as required, and 4.4 Upgrading information technology - obtaining information technology to provide enhanced financing and management facilities. Overall a number of outcomes should be achieved, allowing NFI-India and the involved MSM organizations in the Region to have an increased impact in specific key areas of each component, and developing institutional capacity to work in these areas in a sustainable manner in the future. The focus of the activities will be on groups in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and possibly other countries of the Region as they come forward. Component 1: Strengthen technical support ability: Capacity of NFI partner organizations in the Region strengthened through technical support, and NFI\\'s internal capacity to provide technical assistance improved. Component 2: Developing knowledge management capacity: Flow of information between NFI and its partners improved, and NFI\\'s role as an international knowledge center on HIV/AIDS and sexual and reproductive health of MSM strengthened. NFI\\'s knowledge management plan implemented, and partner organizations and others better supplied with timely and useful knowledge for strategy development, project planning and project management. Enhanced knowledge management of internal resources, including institutional learning. Component 3: Developing advocacy capacity: Enhanced capacity to develop and implement advocacy activities. Improved understanding of MSM issues in South Asia by key influencers. Enhanced capacity to develop and implement advocacy activities. Component 4: Strengthening financing and management capacity: NFI\\'s medium-term financing strategy defined and strengthened, and key grant awards obtained. Enhanced institutional capacity for financing strategy development and implementation. NFI and its partners become more financially sustainable. Management systems enhanced to support organizational objectives over the medium term. It is expected that as a result of this component more MSM groups in the Region will be able to apply for Bank funds under the AIDS projects in the Region. Indicator 1: Technical support - Number of project partners visited for provision of technical support, and number of NFI partner staff and other individuals trained. Indicator 2: Knowledge management - Number of internal and external information requests responded to. Indicator 3: Advocacy: Number of advocacy events organized.

The MYRB will address the weaknesses of the current budget process and the expected benefits are: \"   Clear linkage between the plan and budget, \"   Assist in evaluating the performance of line agencies in terms of outputs deliveries, \"   Improving macroeconomic balance by developing a realistic fiscal revenue framework, \"   Improving resource allocation to strategic priorities within and across sectors, \"   Increasing resource predictability and providing line agencies with resource ceilings, and \"   Provide more autonomy to make decisions for increased efficiency and effectiveness. However, we need the services of technical experts to initiate the MYRB process. The development objective is to help the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) introduce Multi-Year Rolling Budgets (MYRB) (as called for in the revised Financial Rules and Regulations of 2001), and move towards performance budgeting. The MYRB initiative is a central part of the RGoB\\'s efforts to ensure the effective use of public resources. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2007-05-18\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2007-05-18\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-11-18\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-12-08\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Aphichoke Kotikula</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Economist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>akotikula@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"BT\">     <narrative>BHUTAN</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"24010\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Financial policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2007-05-18\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2011-11-18\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">317379.95 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">317379.95  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P104622\">\\n       <narrative>BHUTAN</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">317379.95  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P104622\">\\n       <narrative>BHUTAN</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:37:26\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P104676</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Reform and Modernization of Burundi Mining Code and Agreements</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>The objective of this grant is to build capacity to improve  management and transparency of the mining sector in Burundi.

With the adoption of an aid management system, improvements in data sustainability, quality, and flow will foster more accurate, effective and informed planning, while facilitating better monitoring and evaluation of aid activities. At the same time, improving the quality, flow and timeliness of aid information will also lower the transaction costs associated with these inefficiencies.  As a result of the proposed improvements to data quality and sustainability, the GoB will be able to view the large majority of all aid activities, while enhancing coordination with donors. Ensuring higher quality data and more systematic, transparent flows of information on aid-on the part of the Government and donors-will lay the groundwork for more effective and informed decision-making on how to best allocate aid resources where they are needed most. As building capacity to improve the flow, quality and timeliness of aid information takes a consensus among the various stakeholders, the initial step is to strengthen existing coordination mechanisms to facilitate the dialogue leading to actual data flow. In this context, the activities to be financed under this grant will fall into three main categories: (i)   Strengthening capacity of donor coordination mechanisms (ii)  Building capacity of the data exchange systems and data quality processes (iii) Building capacity within the VIPFE technology group (iv) Improve existing aid management systems The grant will be used to finance the various components of capacity building, including: consultant services, technical support, travel for international consultants, and donor and government coordination workshops and policy seminars, as appropriate. The main development objective oof the grant is to promote development effectiveness and transparency by strengthening the capacity of the Viceministry of Public Investment and External Financing (VIFPE) to effectively coordinate and manage all ODA flows. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-05-15\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-05-15\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-07-14\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-08-01\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Maria Ruth Llanos Vda De Navarro</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Short Term Consultant</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"BO\">     <narrative>BOLIVIA, PLURINATIONAL STATE OF</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public sector policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:37:40\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P104717</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Incorporating Migrant Population into Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Instruments</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>The goal is to build capacity within the Greater Mekong Subregion to measure, monitor and assess the living conditions of migrants so that Governments may effectively and efficiently implement a regional system to regulate labor migration.

Countributing to support Mauritania\\'s efforts to better fight corruption, helping the country to meet its international commitments as set forth in the UN convention in terrorist financing and transnational crime. Ultimately, by helping the country to create an operational AML/CFT system consistent with international standards, the project will prevent financial sector from being used by criminals and reinforce, at the same time, the action on corporate governance/transparency and secure management of oil revenues. Considering the fact that the first disbursement has been done only recently (July 2008), the work program as designed in the IDF project has not been implemented yet. However, the multiple activities on AML than have been initiated by the country over the last 12 months are very encouraging and promising. As an example of this is the enactment of two key regulations from the Central Bank, dated July 29, 2008, instructing banks on how to report suspicious activities to the CANIF. An official template for reporting unusual transactions has also been endorsed and circulated to reporting entities. This is a significant step towards the effective implementation of the AML/CFT law. It is expected that the CANIF will soon receive STRs and start processing reports. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2007-11-30\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2007-11-30\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-05-31\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-07-04\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Marilyne Pereira Goncalves</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Financial Sector Spec.</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>mgoncalves2@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"MR\">     <narrative>MAURITANIA</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"24010\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Financial policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2007-11-30\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-05-31\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">194511.41 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">194511.41  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P104791\">\\n       <narrative>MAURITANIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">194511.41  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P104791\">\\n       <narrative>MAURITANIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:37:47\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P104849</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Capacity Building for Analysis of  Wage and Social Insurance Policies</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative> The grant will strengthen ILSSA\\'s capacity to generate a series of analytical studies, digest them under the form of policy reports, and disseminate the main recommendations to decision makers.  It will also help to facilitate two-way communications between ILSSA and the Departments of Wages and of Social Insurance at MOLISA. Ultimately, ILSSA\\'s analytical work will be driven by practical policy questions raised by the two Departments. There are three components: 1.   Capacity building for revision of the design of the pension ,,program 2.   Capacity building for modernization of labor market ,,regulations: 3.   Policy dialogue and consultation: The ultimate objective is to help MOLISA adopt sound wage and social insurance policies and to operate effectively its regulatory functions in a market economy. This grant will enhance the capacity and effectiveness of ILSSA - the research arm within MOLISA- to conduct policy-oriented analyses through providing timely and effective technical inputs to MOLISA?s Policy Departments. It will also strengthen the two-way link between ILSSA?s analytical work and MOLISA?s decision making in relation to wage policies and pension issues.  ILSSA\\'s role is to provide technical inputs to the departments in charge of formulating and developing policies. However, both ILSSA\\'s inadequate capacity and its weak link with MOLISA\\'s policy departments lead to a fragmentation and a considerable inertia of policy formulation in Vietnam.  Currently, regulations related to the labor market and to social insurance programs are defective in terms of economic efficiency and social protection. In relation to wages, MOLISA has been tasked to revise the wage setting and collective bargaining mechanisms in force, so that they become better suited to the needs of a market economy. ILSSA was mandated to produce solid evidence on how the various wage setting mechanisms in force are working in practice, to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and to make recommendations for the design of the new system. At present minimum wage rules contradict WTO principles, whereas the weaknesses of the industrial relation system have resulted in a series of wildcat strikes.  In relation to pension issues, the first ever Social Insurance Law was passed in June 2006. Now MOLISA is facing the challenging task of developing implementation regulations aimed at expanding the coverage of the social insurance system, ensuring its financial stability in the long run, and providing adequate incentives for enterprises and workers to participate.  Regulations for these two areas should be developed in a coordinated manner. Wage policies affect the operation of the labor market and the extent of formalization, hence the coverage of the social insurance system. The expenditures of the latter, on the other hand, are very sensitive to the level of wages in general, and of minimum wages in particular. Changes in the ratio of minimum to average wages also affect the financial sustainability of the pension system in the long run. It is therefore important that policy decisions related to both wage policy and social insurance policy be based on common grounds.  Given that these two areas fall under responsibility of two different policy units, namely the Department of Wages and the Department of Social Insurance, strengthening the capacity of the institute in charge of providing inputs for both should improve the coherence of the resulting regulations. Currently, ILSSA\\'s inputs have not yet had strong influence on policy formulation made at Policy Departments as they have not met the Departments\\' expectations.

The Bank has established Capacity Building as one of its foundational pillars for its support to the Africa region. The recently adopted Capacity Development Management Action Plan  (CDMAP) states that \"the lack of capacity is a binding constraint to Africa achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\" and calls for region-wide and country-owned support to long term capacity development.

(ii)   undertake an organizational assessment of the Vision Secretariat; and (iii)   develop Citizen Report Card System to hold service providers to account. Link to CAS and/or ESW (Core Diagnostics, e.g., CPAR, CFAA, PER, CEM, etc), and relationship to Bank operations Relationship to country/recipient\\'s development program including donor activities . Brief description of the IDF-financed components and activities Project activities and deliverables include: 1.   Component 1:  Development of a Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy The main components of  the M&amp;E Strategy are to develop a comprehensive results framework of the Vision 2016 to track progress towards the achievement of the key strategic goals; to develop a detailed M&amp;E plan for data collection and analysis, covering baseline, ongoing monitoring and evaluation, reporting flows and formats, a feedback and review plan;  and to undertake capacity building initiatives for the staff of the Vision 2016 Secretariat  and those of implementing partners. 2.   Component 2 Organizational Assessment Organisational assessment by its nature is a complex undertaking that requires a great deal of sensitivity and understanding.  The Vision 2016 Secretariat was recruited to drive the implementation of Vision 2016, the critical question then becomes, does the Secretariat with its organisational structure sufficiently placed to monitor and evaluate the implementation of Vision 2016 as well as publicise it to ensure ownership.  The organisational assessment is intended to challenge how and why things are done the way they are.   The organisational assessment can strengthen Council infrastructure capacity and build strong partnerships Component 3:  Citizen Report Card System Publicity of Vision 2016 is intended to make Batswana internalise Vision 2016 and organisations to align their programmes/policies to the goals of Vision 2016.  The Citizen Report Card System will give Batswana an opportunity to evaluate the services of service providers in line with the aspirations of Vision 2016.  Vision 2016 Council has 8 forums that are to help Council drive the implementation of Vision 2016.  Citizen Report Cards System could be used by the Forums to engage the different stakeholders to pay special attention to areas that lack behind in the implementation process.  Reports Cards System will help in the promotion of Vision 2016 as well as ownership which is currently proving to be elusive. 3. Likely Outcomes of Project Activities . The expected results with M&amp;E strategy are as follows: \\xc3\\x82\\xc2\\xa2   Logical Framework Matrix- Specifying the operations internal design logic (inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes and impacts), indicators at each level, the means of verification for each indicator, and the risks and assumptions (external design logic. \\xc3\\x82\\xc2\\xa2   M&amp;E Plan Matrix - Specifying the indicators for each logical framework design element, data source, or means of verification for each indicator, the frequency and cost of data collection for each indicator, the responsibility for data collection, the method to be used in data collection and how the information will be used. \\xc3\\x82\\xc2\\xa2   Evaluation Plan - identifying the before-and-after comparison of baseline, mid-term review and final evaluation results \\xc3\\x82\\xc2\\xa2   Annual M&amp;E Implementation Plan and Budget - detailed calendar of M&amp;E activities and associated costs. \\xc3\\x82\\xc2\\xa2   M&amp;E Capacity Building Plan describing equipment, training and other requirements needed for the Vision Secretariat and implementing partners to undertake the plans outlined above.    Organisational assessment expected results are: an Organisational Assessment Report that can demonstrate the relevance of Vision 2016 in relation to its mandate and clear development of a strategic plan that can focus the issues captured in the report. The expected results of the citizen report card systems is a clear report and recommendation of linking the citizen Report Cards as an effective tool of Monitoring and Evaluating performance of service providers Key Monitoring Indicators (maximum of 3) 1.

Vision 2016 articulates Botswana\\'s long-term development aspirations and provides a framework for development. It guides the country\\'s six-year National Development Plan. Millennium Development Goals (MDG) resonate well with the seven Vision 2016 pillars which challenge Botswana to be globally competitive and above all, to demonstrate that the historic success in terms of having achieved a tremendous record of economic rate of growth, strong physical and social infrastructure; good economic planning and prudent budget management have had positive outcomes for the people. The Vision 2016 Council/Secretariat, which was setup in 2002 has been given the overall responsibility for tracking the outcomes and impacts of  the Vision 2016 Strategy.  The lack of monitoring systems and inadequate baseline data has made it difficult to assess the overall impact of government programs. The Vision Council is an institutional mechanism that was set up to monitor and evaluate the effective and timely implementation of Vision 2016 by all stakeholders. It has been given the mandate to not only ensure that baseline data is collected, but ensure that over time, internal organizational capacity for data collection and analysis is built to track program outcomes on a systematic basis.  As a Coordinating agency the Council will rely on Sector Ministries and agencies to report on the achievements of the Vision 2016 strategy.  The Council as well as the Sector Ministries and CSOs currently do not have the requisite core M&amp;E competencies to systematically monitor and evaluate the outcomes and impacts of the Vision 2016 Strategy.  It is anticipated that the IDF Grant will be used to strengthen at least 15 sector ministries and at least 60 CSOs drawn from over 200 CSOs that are actively engaged in Vision 2016 Programs. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-11-21\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-11-21\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-05-31\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-04-04\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Roberto O.

The MfDR principles form the basis for sound performance management - focusing on all elements of the project cycle (design, implementation and completion). In managing for results, it is important to have a coherent approach: (a) ex ante, at the strategy and planning phase, when expected results are articulated and their likely costs and expected impact on poverty reduction and development are analyzed, (b) during program/project implementation, when monitoring is needed to assess progress and identify necessary mid-course corrections, (c) ex-post, upon completion, when the results are assessed against objectives and other factors, and (d) also when sufficient time has passed to allow an assessment of sustainability.  The MfDR principles are well-suited for implementation in the context of Turkey where the SPO provides the overall macro framework for planning investments and evaluating project proposals on the basis of this framework, while line ministries are responsible for developing the proposals and project implementation. The choice of the sectors is predicated on the following: (i) Ministry of Transport (MOT) accounts for 50 percent of the total investment budget; (ii) Ministry of Environment (MOE) needs to undertake major investments to meet EU environmental standards; and (iii) social sectors since these sectors exhibit a time-lag between interventions and observed outcomes and require special techniques for MfDR. The proposed IDF grant aims at strengthening the capacity of the Project and Investment Analysis Department (PIAD) of the Turkish State Planning Organization (SPO) in Monitoring and Evaluation for Development Programs (MEDP).  A secondary objective of the IDF is to contribute to greater transparency and accountability for the use of public funds through information sharing.  The MEDP principles form the basis for sound performance management, focusing on all elements of the program/project cycle. In monitoring and evaluation, it is important to have a coherent approach: (a) ex ante, at the strategy and planning phase, when expected results are articulated and their likely costs and expected impact on poverty reduction and development are analyzed; (b) during program/project implementation, when monitoring is needed to assess progress and identify necessary mid-course corrections; (c) ex-post, upon completion, when the results are assessed against objectives and other factors; and (d) also when sufficient time has passed, to allow an assessment of sustainability.  The MEDP principles are well-suited for implementation in Turkey where the SPO provides the overall macro framework for development plans (recently the Ninth Development Plan), prepares medium term and annual programs, and public investment programs in close cooperation with line ministries and public institutions. Line ministries and public institutions are responsible for developing sector-specific strategic plans linked to performance-based budgtes and for identifying and implementing detailed programs and project proposals. Presently, the weakest link in the program/project cycle is in the M&amp;E phase. Therefore, for sound oversight and assessing progress and accomplishment of plans, programs and projects, the capacities for MEDP in SPO and line ministries are to be progressively strengthened.  The development objectives of the proposed IDF are as follows;  1. Assist the Government to develop and implement MEDP in Turkey  2. Improve access of user groups to primary data and ensure effective dissemination of results. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2007-10-05\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2007-10-05\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-04-05\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-02-15\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Carla Pittalis</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Operations Officer</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>cpittalis@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"TR\">     <narrative>TURKEY</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public sector policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2007-10-05\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2011-04-05\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">255495.29 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">255495.29  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P105811\">\\n       <narrative>TURKEY</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">255495.29  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P105811\">\\n       <narrative>TURKEY</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:38:40\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P105837</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>IDF-Capacity Building for Public Sector Auditing</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>In November 2006 the Chamber of Accounts of the Kyrgyz Republic submitted a request to the World Bank for technical assistance to help build its capacity to conduct audits as mandated by the Law. During subsequent meetings in January (led by John Hegarty) and February 2007 the Chairman of the Chamber of Account reiterated the need for technical assistance and training in the area of financial and performance audits, and requested the Bank for financial support.  The Law on the Chamber of Accounts was revised and adopted in August 2005 with support from DFID under the GSAC/DFID Program. this followed recommendations of the CFAA that found the old law to be ineffective and not in line with international standards and practice. Although a modern law on external audit is now in place implementation has been sluggish due to lack of capacity, a fact that is recognized by the Chairman of the Chamber of Accounts. The Chamber of Accounts has not received much financial support from development partners despite recognized limited capacity that constrains its ability to deliver on its mandate as the supreme audit institution. Some support is planned under the Kyrgyz Health &amp; Social Protection (SWAp) Project through a twinning arrangement with the National Audit Office of the UK. However, due to funding constraint this support will be limited to enabling the Chamber of Accounts to audit the Health SWAp for one year and training of auditors involved in the audit of health sector institutions. To respond to the request for support by the Chamber of Accounts I plan to apply for an IDF Grant to support further institutional capacity building by expanding the twinning arrangement to cover other activities not included in the current contract for the twinning assistance. These include hands-on training through joint pilot financial statements and performance audits, the development an institutional development plan to help the Chamber of Accounts progress towards modern approaches to audit, in line with international best practice and training of Chamber of Accounts auditors to acquire certification as envisaged in the Law on the Chamber of Accounts.

More specifically, support will be provided for: i) developing detailed technical requirements and bid documents; ii) updating implementation strategy; and iii) organizing workshops and training to appropriately reflect user needs in technical specifications and to strengthen capacity of those responsible for procuring the GFMIS.  The functional requirements and implementation strategy (a roadmap) for the GFMIS compatible with IMF standards have been developed through an IDF Grant(P081668). The GFMIS will cover the following key Public Financial Management functions: (a) tools for macro economic forecasting; (b) budget planning and preparation module; (c) budget execution (core treasury system) module; (d) support for auditing; (e) HR Management (linked to external centralized system); (f) e-Procurement (linked to external centralized system); and (g) Financial Management Information System. This proposal is intended to build on the achievements of the previous IDF grant to establish solid base and momentum for continued reform in Armenia. The objective of the Grant is consistent with CAS objectives. The CAS for 2004-2008 (June 30, 2004) builds on a strong track record on economic management and reform since the mid-90s and is based on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) developed in a participatory manner. The key thrust of the CAS remains intact in the CAS Progress Report (February 9, 2007). Improving public sector services is a key area in the CAS to achieve one of its focus areas, promotion of private sector led economic growth. Successful implementation of the GFMIS will help enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of government\\'s financial management. The Grant is also expected to complement ongoing IDA support in the public sector through the Public Sector Moderniza tion Project (PSMP).

In particular, enhancing NCIP\\'s capacity for mapping is expected to expedite the processing of proposed development projects in ancestral domain land within the context of protecting the rights of the indigenous peoples (IPs). The proposal is also linked with the Bank\\'s work on strengthening country systems for safeguards in support to the CAS objectives, particularly in facilitating and streamlining of the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) processes and the issuance of IP consent in development interventions falling within the ancestral domain areas. The proposal will eventually support the growth objective by improving environmental and natural resource management as well as the investment climate through strengthening the regulatory capacity of the NCIP. To improve the effectiveness of the country safeguards system on Indigenous Peoples (IPs) with focus on the development of the IP database. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2007-08-15\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2007-08-15\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-02-15\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-03-03\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Victoria Florian S.

To build the capacity of key implementing agencies in Haiti to achieve and report results under donor-funded programs; 2.   To build the capacity of a local entity to provide such capacity building services to other implementing agencies in the future (training for trainers); 3.   To foster an enabling environment for implementing agencies that promotes a sense of ownership, including by addressing the role of donors; and 4.   To establish a network of staff from implementing agencies exchanging relevant and practical information on a regular basis See attached preliminary concept note for more details. The development objective of the Grant is to strengthen the GoH\\'s capacity in the area of project fiduciary management. It would aim to do this by strengthening the Centre de Formation des Agents de la Fonction Publique (CEFOPAFOP, the GoH\\'s capacity building institute) and the Ecole Nationale d\\'Administration Financiere (ENAF - a Government sponsored higher-level education institute focused on financial management) so that they are able to provide a capacity building program in the general principles of procurement, financial management and project management monitoring and evaluation, with a particular emphasis on donor financed projects. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-07-31\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-07-31\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-06-27\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-05-09\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Alexandre Arrobbio</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Country Manager</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>aarrobbio@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"HT\">     <narrative>HAITI</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public sector policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:39:06\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P108167</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Private Sector Development</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>The objective of the grant is build capacity in the State Committee for Investment and   State Property Management (SCISPM).   The SCISPM has a broad mandate for implementing measures to support private sector development in the country, including efforts to improve the business and investment climate, privatization of state-owned assets and the attraction of foreign direct investment, and support to entrepreneurs and small businesses.    In particular, the SCISPM has been mandated  to oversee the implementation of a private sector strategy, based on strategy recently developed by the Bank in collaboration with the donor community and the Government.    The strategy focuses largely on the implementation of a series of investment climate reforms. Specifically, the Grant will support the SCISPM by (i) proposing an enhanced organizational structure, including suggested staffing requirements and competencies as well as workflow processes;  (ii) helping to develop staff capabilities and expertise; and (iii) assisting in the development of management information systems necessary to support  SCISPM operations. The SCISPM, created by government decree in late 2006, is an amalgamation of several state agencies.    As such it lacks a cohesive organizational structure with effective liaison between departments.  There is considerable overlap between units and duplication of managers\\' areas of responsibility, while key areas such as monitoring and evaluation have not been addressed.    In particular, there is a lack of coordination between agency headquarters in Dushanbe and its various regional offices located throughout the country, which complicates supervision and monitoring of agency work around the country.   The Grant would assist it in helping to identify an optimal organizational structure, introduce a human resources function to help match personnel with required areas of expertise and advise on improving project management and optimal work flows between departments. Agency personnel lack sufficient knowledge and expertise in key areas of the agency\\'s mandates.    The merger of several agencies into the SCISPM resulted in staff reductions and assignment of new and additional responsibilities to staff without the necessary expertise or training, particularly in areas related to the implementation of the private sector development strategy.   Staff training programs are lacking and there is no central coordination and planning of staff training requirements.    The Grant will help identify a training officer and advise on the development of a staff training strategy and program.   It will also initiate a training of trainers program to ensure ongoing training for new staff as well as staff in regional offices.   The Grant will support the development of a distance learning course in the basics of investment climate reform and provide the equipment needed to enable interaction with instructors and presenters located in other countries, so that staff may benefit from the experience of officials involved in private sector development in other CIS countries and elsewhere. Finally, the Grant will support the development of key management information systems to help fulfill its mandates.    Though the SCISPM is responsible for the management of state property - much of which is intended to be privatized - it lacks a database of state properties.   Similarly, its mandate in foreign investment promotion is hampered by a lack of an information system on foreign investment in the country.    It would also increase efficiency through the computerization of much of its daily operational work. TF091466 The IDF grant will support the development of a training function and distance learning course designed to build capacity in the State Committee for Investment and State Property Management (SCISPM) to implement reforms to promote the development of the private sector. The SCISPM has a broad mandate for implementing measures to the country\\'s investment climate, managing state-owned property, attracting foreign direct investment and supporting entrepreneurs and small businesses. In particular, the SCISPM has been mandated to oversee the implementation of a private sector development (PSD) strategy, which was approved in the government\\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) and subsequently elaborated in a report recently developed as a result of collaboration between the Bank, donor community and the government. The government\\'s PSD strategy focuses largely on the implementation of a series of investment climate reforms, including the elimination of administrative barriers to investment and constraints to business entry and development, improvements to enterprise access to finance, and various related legal, regulatory and judicial reforms.  Specifically, the Grant will support the SCISPM\\'s PSD reform mandate by building institutional capacity through assistance to the agency in the development of (i) staff capabilities and expertise in relevant PSD issues; and (ii) management information systems necessary to support and enhance SCISPM operations. The grant will be coordinated closely with another grant being provided jointly by ADB and DfID which will inter alia provide a plan for the restructructuring of the agency. It is expected that the restructuring plan will help to improve organizational structure by rationalizing staffing requirements and competencies, which will be supported under the IDF grant by the introduction of a staff training function, the implementation of a training of trainers program and the creation and delivery of distance learning programs. (The restructuring plan was included in an earlier version of this proposal but in the interest of coordination and to prevent duplication, it was agreed with ADB and DfID that the IDF grant would focus on training and related capacity building efforts while the ADB/DfID grant would pursue the rationalization of the structure of the agency. See Other Donor Financing)  Agency personnel lack sufficient knowledge and expertise in key areas of the agency&amp;#146;s mandates. The merger of several agencies expertise or training, particularly in areas related to the implementation of the private sector development strategy. Staff training programs are lacking and there is no central coordination and planning of staff training requirements.  The grant will help identify a training officer and advise on the development of a staff training strategy and program. It will also initiate a training of trainers program to ensure ongoing training for new staff as well as staff in regional offices. The grant will support the development of a distance learning course in the basics of investment climate reform and provide the electronic equipment needed to enable interaction with instructors and presenters located in other countries, so that staff will benefit from the experience of officials involved in private sector development in other CIS republics and elsewhere, despite the country&amp;#146;s remote location and without incurring the expense of on-site presentations. This activity will help ensure that agency staff learn what they need to know about investment climate reform in order to ensure that the government plays an integral role in the development and implementation of the PSD components, in the process ensuring that components reflect the needs of the country and are not simply left to the work of the international consultants and donor agencies that will provide support. For these reasons the equipment can be expected to support learning programs conducted in the future, in addition to the distance learning program to be developed under this grant. In addition, the team of trainers trained under the grant will deliver the distance learning course to new and regional agency staff.  The grant will support the development of key database management systems to help improve the agency\\'s institutional capacity to fulfill its mandates. Though the SCISPM is responsible for the management of state property, it lacks a database of these properties. Similarly, its mandate in foreign investment promotion is hampered by a lack of an information systems on foreign investment in the country. It would also increase efficiency through the computerization of much of its daily operational work. These databases would help to build institutional capacity by enabling the agency to effectively control and management property, assisting it in maintain these properties and/or determining how and for how much they should be sold. The agency will thus be better equipped institutionally to attract investment to state-owned enterprises once it has more complete and up-to-date data on them and on recent foreign investments in the country. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-02-16\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-02-16\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-08-16\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-06-30\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Andrea Mario Dall\\'Olio</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Lead Country Economist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>adallolio@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"TJ\">     <narrative>TAJIKISTAN</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"25.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public sector policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector> <sector code=\"32120\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"70.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Industrial development]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector> <sector code=\"32210\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"5.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Mineral/mining policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-02-16\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2011-08-16\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">491269.54 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">491269.54  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P108167\">\\n       <narrative>TAJIKISTAN</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">491269.54  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P108167\">\\n       <narrative>TAJIKISTAN</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:39:09\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P108357</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Public Debt Management</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative> The objective of this project is to build institutional capacity in the Debt Management Division (DMD) of the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MoFE) in Armenia in order to prepare and implement a medium-term government debt management strategy and to help promote the development of a local market for government securities.

Such a goal will be pursued through building institutional capacity on designing and implementing a debt management strategy and in promoting the better functioning of the primary market for local currency debt.    This project brings public debt management in Armenia closer to international sound practice by providing technical assistance to build up institutional capacity in the Debt Management Division of the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MoFE). Such assistance will help the debt manager prepare and implement a medium-term formal debt management strategy taking into consideration cost-risk analysis as well as the authorities? plan to promote the development of a local market for government securities. In addition, the project aims at fostering sustainable debt market development, mainly through the reform of primary and money markets.    The rationale for this project relates to Armenia?s graduation from IDA in 2008 and to the pension reform and higher government spending that will significantly increase the funding requirements from AMD60 in 2007 to over AMD200 billions in 2012. These events will likely result in a gradual reduction of the foreign currency debt (almost exclusively obtained in concessional terms), broadening the choices for government borrowing and presenting Armenia with significant challenges and opportunities for debt management and debt market development. The authorities need to prepare for a situation in which a growing portion of the government borrowing is contracted at market terms. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-05-15\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-05-15\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-12-24\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-11-04\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Karen Grigorian</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Private Sector Specialist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>kgrigorian@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"AM\">     <narrative>ARMENIA</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"24010\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Financial policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-05-15\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2011-12-24\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">490740.15 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">490740.15  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P108357\">\\n       <narrative>ARMENIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">490740.15  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P108357\">\\n       <narrative>ARMENIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:39:13\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P109174</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Support to African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET)</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative> The objective of this grant is the functional establishment of the African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET), an African-led, regional non-profit policy research and advocacy institution to be based in Accra, Ghana.

In the last ten years there has been virtually no improvement in the Tajik tax service. Tax to GDP ratio remains among the lowest among CIS countries (16.8 including social payments). Tax arrears have risen by about 65  million somoni in 2006 alone, and stand at 224 million somoni.  representing more than 20 percent of net annual collection. Business processes of Tajik tax service are manual, inefficient, and lack transparency.  Perhaps most importantly, despite commitment of the highest leadership, there is a lack of capacity on all levels to implement reforms. The tax system is incapable to sustain further increase in the collection of revenue without a comprehensive reform that would increase capacity, introduce modern and transparent business practices, and ensure voluntary compliance of the majority of tax payers.  The above reforms would have far-reaching implications for improved governance and business climate in the country, supporting further growth and development. In particular, this grant will support TC in the following areas:  (i) developing a comprehensive strategy for tax reforms, including conducting a functional review, IT review and a thorough analysis of institutional development needs, and development of a concept paper for comprehensive tax modernization;  (ii) supporting implementation of urgent reforms, such as adoption of taxpayer register; harmonization of the Tax Code with the Civil Code; and (iii) strengthening human capital and institutional capacity of TC, including training in  collection of tax arrears, and collection of social security taxes, as well as capacity building in the TC to implement and manage reforms. The authorities of the Republic of Tajikistan are committed to modernizing their tax system.  This Grant proposal responds to an urgent request for assistance by the Chairman of TC. However, besides the leadership of the Tax Committee, the team has discussed these issues with the high-level policy decision-makers such as the Economic Advisor to the President and the Minister of Finance, who fully support the modernization of the tax system.  The request for assistance is formulated both in terms of the immediate needs of the Tax Committee and medium-term comprehensive tax modernization effort.  While the IDF grant would lay the groundwork for tax system modernization by supporting the strategy development, urgent reforms, and capacity building, the mid- to long-term reform needs of TC could possibly be addressed by securing a multi-donor trust fund at a future date.

To this end, the proposed Grant would support the KJC in achieving the following priority outcomes: (a) Establishing an electronic database of the existing backlog of cases to allow the KJC to effectively track these cases and identify appropriate resource requirements for accelerating the disposition of these cases; and (b) Using court statistics to effectively monitor the performance of the courts in terms of timely processing of cases; and to adjust resource allocations for individual courts according to caseload. The outstanding backlog of cases represents a major impediment to the courts\\' capacity to process the incoming caseload, which has been rising in recent years, in a timely manner. At the same time, the Kosovo Judicial Council is not currently in a position to use judicial statistics as an effective management tool to monitor courts\\' caseloads and track the progress of outstanding cases. At present, data on incoming and completed cases are compiled manually by the courts and errors are reportedly frequent. A recently completed project funded by the European Agency for Reconstruction has financed the development of a Case Management Information System (CMIS) that the KJC will begin to use as of October 2007 to register and track incoming cases. However, the courts do not have the capacity to register the existing backlog of over 231,000 cases in the CMIS, so that the KJC can effectively track their progress and target resources at expediting their disposition. The proposed IDF grant would therefore finance the registration of the case backlog in an electronic database, which - once completed - would be incorporated into the CMIS system, to allow the KJC to effectively analyze, track, and take appropriate steps to tackle the outstanding backlog. It would also provide targeted technical assistance to allow the KJC to utilize this data in monitoring courts\\' performance and optimizing the efficienct allocation of resources to individual courts.

According to the Government\\'s 5 year development plan, findings from WBG\\'s ESW, and recommendations from other donors, the success of ISPAT will depend on the development of a comprehensive business plan and the development of its institutional capacity to implement its objectives.  The Government and donors recognize that the ISPAT will also need to be supported by building national and international cooperation networks with relevant local organization as well as with counterparts in partner and competitor countries.  The development of the business plan needs to be underpinned with an in-depth analysis pf Turkey\\'s international competitiveness across all sectors and with assistance to identify quick-win as well as long-term objectives through a targeted selection of potential FDI recipient industries and source countries.  All of this requires a strategic approach by a well trained management and technical staff. As such, this grant proposal includes 4 activities under one component: 1.   Drafting of a comprehensive business plan, based on a needs assessment of ISPAT and a SWOT analysis of Turkey\\'s competitiveness, 2.   Development of a supporting training program that meets short terms needs and provides in-house training capacity for future needs, 3.   Establishment of local and international partnerships to create multiplier effect of ISPAT\\'s efforts through building sub-national and satellite investment promotion capacity, 4.   Development of case studies as key instruments to highlight Turkey\\'s strengths and investment opportunities. TF091433 The objectives of the Project are to support capacity building of the Investment Strategy and Promotion Agency of Turkey (ISPAT) and to develop a comprehensive business plan that will improve its ability to design and implement strategies to attract foreign direct investment in selected industries. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-03-11\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-03-11\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-09-11\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-07-18\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Carlos Pinerua</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Program Manager</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"TR\">     <narrative>TURKEY</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"24010\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"50.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Financial policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector> <sector code=\"33110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"50.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Trade policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-03-11\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2011-09-11\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">402828.07 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">402828.07  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P109379\">\\n       <narrative>TURKEY</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">402828.07  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P109379\">\\n       <narrative>TURKEY</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:39:29\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P109392</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Jordan Measuring the Impact of National Policies and Strategies on Gender Equality</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>Enhancing capacity and knowledge of government institutions and ministries to monitor and evaluate impact of policies and strategies on gender equality.  The overall development objective of this program is to strengthen and increase knowledge, accountability, and monitoring mechanisms within the government of Jordan to measure the influence of national policies, and initiatives on progress towards gender equality. There is a critical need to monitor and evaluate what the government has been supporting in terms of activities and initiatives for women?s advancement. Despite the significant steps that Jordanian society has taken in the advancement of women in development, and the number of initiatives, activities, and funding that have gone to this issue, little is known about the level of success that has been achieved. Furthermore, indicators on women?s empowerment in the area of labor force participation, entrepreneurship and public office are uncharacteristically low given their level of education.  So far, it has not been possible to measure the specific impact of policies, programs and projects on Jordan\\'s performance in gender equality. Funding from the donor community tends to focus on women#s human rights and political participation rather than economic development and no funding has been made available to address the issue of M &amp; E. In addition to helping address gender disparities the funds from the IDF could open an opportunity for the government to leverage additional funding for M &amp; E from other donors.  The Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) which acts as the de facto gender focal point for the government, has played a pivotal role in integrating gender within Jordan?s development plans and strategies however, MOPIC lacks the mechanisms and capacity to monitor and evaluate national and sub-national initiatives from a gender perspective. In addition the Gender Division at the Department of Statistics (DOS) indicates the need for statistics on issues that affect women either disproportionately or exclusively. Some of those issues include: poverty, informal employment, access to economic opportunities, access to and control over economic assets (such as credit, social security, pensions, safety nets, land, and property); political participation within all avenues of the public sphere, time-use, school attendance, maternal mortality and morbidity, gender attitudes and violence against women.  Specific Objectives:  1. Enhance the institutional capacity of MOPIC#s monitoring and evaluation process to conduct M &amp; E on government projects and policy initiatives related to the CAS from a gender perspective  2. Enhance the national database at the department of statistics with gender indicators on key thematic areas relevant to the government work program and the CAS to be linked to MOPIC#s M &amp; E system (e.g. informal employment, credit, pensions, safety nets etc.) with the potential of expanding to other sectors.  3. Enhance the overall capacity and raise awareness of key national agencies such as the ministries of labor, health, social affairs, civil service, and the national department of statistics to generate and integrate gender statistics in their work and projects. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-11-10\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-11-10\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2013-05-09\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2013-07-29\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Randa Akeel</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Financial Sector Spec.</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>rakeel@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"JO\">     <narrative>JORDAN</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public sector policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-11-10\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2013-05-09\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">276848.87 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">276848.87  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P109392\">\\n       <narrative>JORDAN</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">276848.87  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P109392\">\\n       <narrative>JORDAN</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:39:33\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P109434</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Policy-Based Budgeting in a Medium-Term Framework</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>This IDF project will support institutionalization of policy and expenditure analysis capability in the Department of Budget and Management of the Government of the Philippines.  It combines hands-on capacity building activities and advisory for refining the annual budgeting and medium-term expenditure planning process.  These activities form the core of the ongoing medium-term expenditure framework initiative.  The grant is intended to provide advice and technical assistance to strengthen the government#s capacity in policy-based budgeting as an element of its medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). The government\\'s enhanced capacity to develop sound policy analysis would improve the quality of its advice to the cabinet-level Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) and the President. This in turn can contribute to improved strategic allocation of budgetary resources on a sustainable basis by informing political decisions with sound technical analyses and systematic internal consultations at the technical level, while reducing dependence on analytical support from the Bank and other development partners over time.  The current round of MTEF development in the Philippines consists of three technical instruments: (i) forward estimates (FEs) of budgetary costs of existing policies, programs and projects in each department; (ii) medium-term sectoral expenditure plans (for selected departments); and (iii) a paper on budget strategy (PBS). The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) coordinates the process, updates the FEs annually, and prepares a PBS which reviews priority expenditure policy issues and recommends decisions. Strategic allocation of budgetary resources is achieved by (i) estimating the total \"allocable\" resource envelope based on the forward estimates (i.e., the cost of ongoing programs and projects) and the revenue projection; and (ii) determining how this \"allocable\" amount should be distributed to different departments on the basis of policy advice contained in the PBS.  For the past two budget cycles, the PBS has emerged as a relevant input for high-level budgetary decisions by the DBCC, the full cabinet and the president. Much of the input originated from Bank-supported analytical work, even though the DBM has been fully in charge of finalizing the PBS document. The proposed grant will support strengthening of the DBM\\'s capacity to manage production of sound policy and expenditure analysis and thus its \"graduation\" from fairly extensive reliance on the Bank and other development partners in producing analytical inputs for the PBS. It will also help the government refine the internal process of consultations and joint decision-making.  The proposed grant will facilitate parallel initiatives by certain line departments which are developing their own medium-term spending plans. The grant will be used to establish better linkage between these sector-led initiatives and the DBM-led MTEF reform.  The overall objective of this grant is to help institutionalization of the MTEF process as a credible tool for guiding the government\\'s policy-based budgeting exercise. Such institutionalization is more likely in the Philippines by making sure that the key decision-makers perceive the tool (MTEF, in this case) as reliable, useful and credible rather than by, for example, formal codification (e.g., an executive order mandating the MTEF process). During the last two budget cycles (2006-2007), the MTEF has proven to be useful tools for actual decision-making and the grant is intended to support the continuation and strengthening of this momentum.  An IDF grant is an appropriate instrument for these objectives given that the grant will permit more extensive technical assistance than what a Bank-executed AAA could provide. With the grant, the focus of the Bank support will shift from offering analytical advice directly on the basis of Bank-executed studies to facilitating the DBM to manage production of required analytical inputs for the annual PBS process. The DBM envisions that some of the analyses will be done #in-house# by its staff, with advice and mentoring from expert consultants to be hired with the grant\\'s financial assistance while others will be contracted out, in which case, an adviser to be hired with the grant will coach the DBM staff in supervising consultants and assuring quality of their outputs. The basic modality of this capacity building is \"learning-by-doing\" whereby DBM staff will actually produce analytical outputs as well as manage consultants hired to produce reports under the guidance of specially-hired senior consultant(s) acting as mentors/coaches. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-07-09\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-07-09\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-01-09\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-01-20\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Karl Kendrick Tiu Chua</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Short Term Consultant</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"PH\">     <narrative>PHILIPPINES</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"33.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public sector policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector> <sector code=\"15111\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"67.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public finance management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-07-09\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-01-09\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">288858.84 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">288858.84  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P109434\">\\n       <narrative>PHILIPPINES</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">288858.84  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P109434\">\\n       <narrative>PHILIPPINES</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:39:36\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P109457</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Pacific Islands -Institutional Capacity Building for Labor Export in the Pacific</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative> The program aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of labor-sending Pacific governments to effectively and efficiently regulate, manage and benefit from the temporary movement of unskilled labor into neighbouring developed countries. This will involve: 1. Developing an appropriate legislative framework to support the circular flow of seasonal migrant workers; 2. Providing adequate pre-departure training, awareness and re-orientation program; 3. Developing a database of workers for monitoring and evaluation. To strengthen the institutional capacity of labour-sending Pacific governments to effectively and efficiently regulate, manage and benefit from the temporary movement of unskilled labour into neighbouring developed countries.  At the global level, the importance of migration in addressing poverty alleviation is increasingly being recognized. In the Pacific, the World Bank, is at the forefront of the migration policy dialogue and important progress has been made in opening up developed country markets to temporary workers from the Pacific.  However, as we know from our vast experience in liberalizing trade in goods, market access does not always translate into market entry without attention to trade-facilitation measures \\xc3\\x82\\xe2\\x80\\x93 also known as \\xc3\\x82\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbehind-the-border\\xc3\\x82\\xe2\\x80\\x9d issues \\xc3\\x82\\xe2\\x80\\x93 which the Bank is increasingly supporting with analytical and technical assistance.. Similar assistance is now needed by labour-exporting countries, particularly the small remote islands in the Pacific which face challenges in building up the capacity to create the public goods that are needed for labour export.  The development benefits of greater access of unskilled Pacific workers to external labour markets\\xc3\\x82\\xe2\\x80\\x94particularly for countries which have had limited migration options\\xc3\\x82\\xe2\\x80\\x94are threefold. At the individual level, the migrant worker who would otherwise be unemployed or underemployed in his/her home country now has a job and income as well as new skills that can be brought home. Access to external labour markets may be their best chance for earning a livelihood.  At the household and community level, remittances are found to have reduced poverty and have served a social protection role by providing a consumption cushion for the poor and vulnerable populations in the Pacific. Where the poor or unskilled have migration options, remittances tend to benefit the poorest, resulting in improved income distribution. Remittances have also been used to finance education and result as well in some increase in business activity. Non-migrant households and churches also receive some remittances, pointing to the multiplier effect of labour mobility in the Pacific. (At Home and Away, World Bank, 2006) Few instruments offer such a direct impact on improving the welfare of the poor.  At the national level, remittances have provided a stable source of foreign exchange (overshadowing FDI and ODA) and have supported the balance of payments which is highly susceptible to terms of trade shocks. Remittances in the Pacific (42% of GDP in Tonga, 27% in Samoa and 7% in Fiji, in 2005) have been steadily increasing at an average of 27% for the period 2000-05. In addition to financial remittances, mobility for unskilled labour can improve social equity in sending countries, reduce social tensions, and create a larger constituency for economic growth and governance reform.  For these remote island countries where the economic base is narrow, population growth is escalating and the cost disadvantages of size and location is formidable, migration and remittances becomes an important tool for development. It is also becoming urgent as rising social tensions resulting from large groups of restless unemployed youth (about 40% of population) can exacerbate the fragility of the state. By strengthening the institutional capacity to successfully manage labour export, migration can contribute to better outcomes for the poor and to social stability in the Pacific region. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2009-05-08\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2009-05-08\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-05-08\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-06-29\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Manjula M.

The proposed grant aims to improve the standard accounting and reporting system of line ministries so that it can produce the project financial reports required by donor, hence eliminating the current practice of maintaining separate accounting systems to accommodate donors reporting requirement. The grant includes technical assistance from qualified international and local consultants, and training to selected line ministry users once the system is developed and installed.  The activities: 1. Review the current accounting systems at the line ministries. The review would focus on how the existing overall system should be modified to incorporate the World Bank#s reporting requirements, without  maintaining a separate, parallel system just to report to the Bank and other donors;. 2. Modification of the accounting system application program and the related rules and procedures; 3. Pilot implementation to selected line ministries; and 4. Training to selected line ministries (which manage World Bank-funded projects)  to disseminate the newly developed reporting tool The proposed grant aims to improve the financial reporting system of line ministries so that the financial reports produced have adequate information for effective decision making.  The objective is to obviate the necessity of generating mutliple reports for various donor partners -  and placing more reliance on the country system. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-09-15\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-09-15\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-03-15\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-05-16\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Unggul Suprayitno</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Financial Management Specialist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"ID\">     <narrative>INDONESIA</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"24010\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Financial policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-09-15\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-03-15\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">42425.11 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">42425.11  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P109458\">\\n       <narrative>INDONESIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">42425.11  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P109458\">\\n       <narrative>INDONESIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:39:43\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P109572</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Strengthening Forest Monitoring</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>The primary objective of the grant is to develop and strengthen Armenia\\'s forest institutions\\' capacities to combat illegal logging and other forest violations. The second objective of the grant is to create a model of public awareness and promote public participation for complex monitoring of illegal use of forest resources. In particular, the grant will support: (a) building capacity to strengthen the forest monitoring; (b) developing innovative and new systems and procedures for effective forest monitoring; and (c) promoting public awareness and strengthening public participation to combat illegal forest use in a sustained manner. These objectives are closely linked with the on-going Bank-government policy dialogue on combating illegal logging and forest removal through the series of four consecutive PRSCs in the past four years. This dialogue resulted in an increasing commitment by the government to combat illegal logging, demonstrated with continuous legal and institutional reforms, such as adoption of the new Forest Policy and Strategy, Forest Code, and Illegal logging Action Plan and establishment of an autonomous state forest monitoring system.

More specifically, the Grant will build the country#s capacity to implement a results-based budgeting framework (RBB), estimate fiscal pressures from public pensions and promote transparency and policy dialogue on key fiscal issues. The Grant combines hands-on capacity building activities and advisory consultancies to: (a) define the methodology and indicators for adopting a results based budgeting framework and develop information systems needed for better fiscal management; (b) promote the public#s access to these fiscal indicators and information systems, and (c) foster key policy dialogue and consensus building in the Legislative Assembly to improve the fiscal management process.  Background: The Grant would be extremely timely as El Salvador is currently going through an information and transparency gap that is hindering policy making in key areas, including fiscal and public debt management. Although the Executive enjoyed a strong mandate at the beginning of this administration, political polarization led to rapid deterioration of Government#s ability to reach consensus in Congress. Mid-term elections held in 2006 consolidated the opposition#s strength in Congress and the situation has deteriorated since then. This political polarization is partially caused by the lack of consistent and technically robust information on public sector performance available to the general public, which creates further mistrust and political stalemate. For example, several multilateral loans in the amount of $500 million were recently cancelled as they were not approved by Congress, mostly due to the opposition#s doubts on the proper use and development impact of these financial resources. The activities the Grant will finance will serve as a consensus building vehicle to protect key public policies from this political polarization. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-10-24\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-10-24\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2013-04-24\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2013-03-22\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Maria Gonzalez de Asis</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Practice Manager</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>mgonzalezasis@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"SV\">     <narrative>EL SALVADOR</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"25.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public sector policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector> <sector code=\"15111\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"50.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public finance management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector> <sector code=\"15113\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"25.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Anti-corruption organisations and institutions]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-10-24\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2013-04-24\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">377942.64 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">377942.64  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P109677\">\\n       <narrative>EL SALVADOR</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">377942.64  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P109677\">\\n       <narrative>EL SALVADOR</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:39:52\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P109696</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Creation of a Public Observatory of Municipal Management</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>The objective of the grant is to improve municipal administration in selected municipal governments by contributing to institution building and to the strengthening of social accountability, through the creation of a Public Observatory of Municipal Management that will be used by both public servants and civil society.

A major procurement reform is currently being undertaken at the Federal level, the start of which was financed by an IDF Grant of 2003, and a follow up Credit (ERGP) with a sub-component of Public procurement reforms in 2005. Similar reforms are needed at the State level since the States in Nigeria have been awarded substantial independence. Under the National Constitution, procurement reforms are the prerogative of the States. The objective is to achieve similar goals as at the Federal level in terms of institutional and legal framework, due process of public procurement for goods, works and consulting services, broader participation of the private sector and transparency.  The Development objective of the Grant is to strengthen the capacity of the Ekiti State Due Process office to institute procurement processes and practice that promote accountability and efficient use of public resources. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-08-06\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-08-06\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-02-06\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-01-18\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Bayo Awosemusi</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Lead Procurement Specialist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"NG\">     <narrative>NIGERIA</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15112\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Decentralisation and support to subnational government]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-08-06\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-02-06\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">423154.80 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">423154.80  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P109711\">\\n       <narrative>NIGERIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">423154.80  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P109711\">\\n       <narrative>NIGERIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:39:59\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P109751</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>BR Sao Paulo Municipal Government (PMSP) Capacity Building for M&amp;E</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>The project will support the building up of the M&amp;E system at the municipal government of S\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\xa3o Paulo city.

and to the Regulator for (a) updating sector regulations, (b) updating the tariff schedule, (c) updating generation studies to provide a long term solution to the current electricity crisis, (d) designing regulations for attracting renewables to the generation business, including sugar mills, and (e) assisting in putting together a generation plan.  Title: Strengthening Results-Based Management in the social sectors in Central America Countries: Costa Rica, Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras. Rationale: (1) There is a strong interest from social sector agencies in the region in strengthening their capacity for results-based management. (2) It is critical to develop strong, sector-level capacity for results-based management to complement and support public sector management reforms at the central level (SIAF, etc.). (3) Strengthening results-based management in the social sectors is particularly critical given the large share of  public expenditures absorbed by the social sectors. (4) The improvement of monitoring systems to inform decision-making and support transparency is a key recommendation in most Poverty Assessments recently conducted in the region. (5) There have been a number of efforts undertaken recently to strengthen the stewardship role of the state in the social sectors, particularly with respect to anti-poverty programs. Activities that would be supported under the IDF: 1)  Development of a Results-Readiness Assessment Tool to determine the practices and gaps in agencies tasked with administering social programs. This tool will guide the baseline diagnostic of the institutional structure of existing performance management systems, as well as a stock-taking of the technical tools and platforms available, and the extent of their use in decision-making by policymakers and other stakeholders, especially citizens/beneficiaries. 2)  Application of the results readiness assessment tool to a few selected agencies in Central America, with a particular focus on agencies tasked with the coordination of a range of anti-poverty programs or which involve numerous agencies or programs and hence call for rather complex M&amp;E systems. 3)  Knowledge Sharing on Systems and Tools: Identify successful sectoral M&amp;E systems in the region, with a focus on identifying innovative tools and systems which have promoted a shift towards results-based management in the social sectors.  Have a workshop to share experience in setting up effective results-based management systems in social sectors. The workshops would provide a venue to share the experience documented in the Results-readiness assessments and the cases of innovative tools and systems. In recent years, several countries in Central America have created new agencies and launched ambitious strategies aimed at promoting greater coherence among a range of anti-poverty programs with the goal of strengthening their social protection systems. The purpose of this project is to inform these initiatives aimed at improving the management of poverty alleviation programs by: (i) producing a diagnostic tool to assess the institutional and information base of these agencies results monitoring systems; (ii) applying this tool to assess the results-readiness of selected social protection agencies and to develop action plans; (iii) reaching an agreement amongst the participating countries on the use of the approach and promoting a regional dialogue on options and recommendations for strengthening these systems; and (iv) promoting knowledge sharing among these programs and with broader established networks of practitioners. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2009-04-30\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2009-04-30\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-09-30\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-08-09\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Pablo Ariel Acosta</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Lead Economist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>pacosta@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"2\"/> <recipient-region code=\"389\">   <narrative>North and Central America regional</narrative>\\n       </recipient-region> <sector code=\"11120\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"30.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Education facilities and training]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector> <sector code=\"12110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"30.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Health policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector> <sector code=\"16010\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"40.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Social Protection]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2009-04-30\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-09-30\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">185364.53 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">185364.53  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P109760\">\\n       <narrative>North &amp;

As the main environmental authority in Peru, CONAM currently faces a number of challenges which hamper its overall ability to carry out its functions and ensure an efficient environmental management. Among the challenges faced by CONAM (as per the 2007 Peru Country Environmental Assessment) are: (i) a limited capacity to carry out an efficient financial management of its operations (including financial accountability); (ii) lack of planning and weak capacity to establish environmental (and fiduciary) priorities; (iii) lack of monitoring and evaluation systems.  In addition, the general law of the environment which provides a number of institutional reforms which could strengthen CONAM needs to be regulated. The proposed IDF, which has been requested by CONAM would contribute in addressing the above referenced institutional challenges by strengthening its internal planning and administrative capacity (particularly with regards to financial management): its ability to carry out monitoring and evaluation of its projects and programs (which would allow it to make strategic decisions), and improve its overall environmental monitoring systems.  Lastly, the IDF would contribute in identifying the legal reforms (and regulations) which could enhance the overall capacity of CONAM The IDF would complement the Environmental DPL programmed for Peru (FY09). Peru is one of the most ecologically diverse countries in the world, endowed with a wealth of natural resources and varied territory. But economic development, occurring in the absence of adequate environmental safeguards throughout Peru#s history, has degraded its natural resources and resulted in serious environmental problems. Unsustainable mining, fishing and agricultural practices and pollution from domestic and industrial sources have generated significant negative impacts on Peru#s ecosystems and public health. Massive overcapacity of the fishing fleet undermines sustainability and threatens a collapse of the anchoveta industry key sector of Peru#s economy. Waterborne diseases and health problems associated with indoor and outdoor air pollution have very high public health costs. According to the 2007 Country Environmental Analysis (CEA), these costs reach 3.7 percent of GDP per year, and primarily affect the poor. Urban air pollution, one of the most serious problems in Peru#s cities, is responsible for an estimated 3,900 premature deaths per year.  The Government of Peru has responded to these challenges by strengthening the environmental management framework. The National Code for Environmental and Natural Resources, adopted in 1990, is a milestone in Peru#s environmental regulation and the first effort to integrated different actions by different entities to control air, water, noise and visual pollution. Since 1993, the National Institute for Natural Resources (INRENA) is the principal agency responsible for natural resources management in Peru; special directorates in sectoral ministries perform additional regulatory and environmental management functions. In 1994, Peru created the National Council for the Environment (CONAM) as an inter-institutional coordinating body with a mandate to propose, manage and evaluate national environmental policy.  Despite significant progress towards a stronger environmental management framework and coordination between different agencies and actors at national and regional levels, CONAM#s implementation capacity remains weak. It lacks real power to monitor and enforce the application of environmental laws and regulations, and has been characterized as a frail agency that has a low profile and lacks citizen participation, a major handicap in the environmental institutional framework in Peru. Furthermore, environmental expenditures are very low by international standards, only about a quarter of a percent of GDP, contributing to weak institutional capacity. The Government is seeking to improve the effectiveness of environmental regulation and monitoring through strengthening CONAM#s enforcement capacity and improving allocation of public expenditures.  The World Bank has received a request for an IDF grant from Peru\\'s National Council for the Environment (CONAM) in order to strengthen the overall technical and administrative capacity of the institution. The IDF would seek to support: (i) an increase in the ability of CONAM to carry out financial planning and improve its administrative capacity to channel resources to priority programs/activities; (ii) mainstream and expedite the financial management procedures; (iii) develop the capacity to monitor and evaluate CONAM#s programs and activities in order to draw lessons, make corrections, assess overall impact. The above in turn would contribute in strengthening CONAM#s tools for environmental management (i.e. environmental monitoring, policy formulation, licensing, inter-institutional coordination etc.) since public resources would be timely and efficiently allocated.  Thus the institution#s environmental management capacity would be improved.

Component: Development and Design of Institutional Strategic Plan To provide technical assistance to the SFC/CGU to re-articulate its role, approach and methodology in the execution of its Constitutional mandate.  This would be an integral step in helping to clarify and update the overall oversight and control framework through a clarification of roles, responsibilities and functions of various control units.  This would enable the SFC/CGU to implement fully a risk-based audit methodology, place increased reliance on improved sector and sub-national control functions, and bring about more comprehensive oversight of public expenditure. Outcome As is normal with the development of systems to increase fiscal transparency, measurable outcomes are difficult to establish. It is known, however, that a functional public financial management system has implications for public expenditure management at four main levels: (i) it contributes to fiscal discipline by providing timely and reliable information on budget execution and by enforcing expenditure limits in accordance with approved budgets and cash flows; (ii) increases operational efficiency by expediting and standardizing processes; (iii) supports preventive and ex-post controls through transactional safeguards and audit trails; and (iv) contributes to transparency by facilitating the publication of budget execution reports. Of course, the IDF grant would not support operation of the system but aspects of design, for which the outcomes will necessarily be key outputs. These will comprise the changes brought about by the financed activities, basically the existence of a well-designed strategic plan for institutional modernization, with embedded good practice in fiscal transparency/oversight and with clear plans for implementation. 2. Component: Development and Modernization of Investigative Tools and Methodologies To provide technical assistance to the CGU in the design and development of modern audit tools and investigative methodologies.  As public expenditure programs have become more complex and comprehensive in Brazil (majority of federal transfer programs have national coverage), there is an urgent need to not only become more efficient and effective in the oversight of public expenditure, but to increase the scope and impact of fiscal oversight to ensure a reduction in wasteful spending.  This component would assist the CGU in the development of new tools that will enable it to broaden coverage, improve technical methodology and techniques to detect instances of waste and fraud, and to improve its ability to rely on sub-systems of line ministries and sub-national governments. As is normal with the development of knowledge to increase fiscal transparency, measurable outcomes are difficult to establish, for which the outcomes will necessarily be key outputs. These will comprise the changes brought about by the financed activities, basically the design of new information technology tools (software, model for a new data warehouse, etc.),and the development of new audit and investigative tools, including forensic auditing, operational or performance auditing, sampling and testing methodologies, etc. and that contributes actively to the country\\'s fiscal transparency and governance agenda. Overall goal. The ultimate development purpose of the grant would be to strengthen fiscal transparency - and, as such, governance, voice and accountability - through the refinement of the role, scope of work, methodologies, and work tools, as well as by establishing new partnerships and better integration of the control framework.  Specific objectives. The specific objective of the grant is to build capacity in the Controller General#s office (CGU) to enable the CGU to implement fully a risk-based audit methodology, place increased reliance on improved sector and sub-national control functions, and bring about more comprehensive oversight of public expenditure. The output of the successful completion of grant activities would be to provide the CGU with a complete, detailed plan for modernization of the oversight and control function of the federal government of Brazil. The proposed grant represents an important opportunity for the Bank to offer its expertise and technical assistance to the government of Brazil in helping it to modernize and upgrade a critical component of its core management systems as part of the government effort to improve the quality of public expenditure and oversight.  Rationale and Background. Despite the robust control framework in place for government operations, comprising various levels of oversight, there exist gaps with regard to the responsibility of oversight of large federal programs that transfer financial resources to sub-national governments and entities. It would also be important to clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of CGU the Tribunal de Contas da Uni\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\xa3o (TCU), and the internal control units of federal and sub-national ministries to not only avoid overlap of functions, but more importantly to eliminate gaps in the framework for oversight and control.  The execution of internal audits, as well as periodic reviews by the Federal Secretary of Control (SFC), the CGU unit primarily responsible for audit and compliance reviews is contemplated in the GOB#s Decreto 3.591, which defines the internal control system of the Executive. Internal audit units, where they may exist, report to line ministries and are responsible for the oversight of day-to-day operations (primarily focused on compliance with rules and regulations for budget execution and procurement). The SFC audit teams operate on a system of #sorteos#, random selections of executing units and budget programs subject to audit - in theory, the SFC audit should be more focused on the attestation and reliability of financial statements and the proper usage of financial resources. While there be may cases of overlap of responsibilities or functions, in practice there is also a sizeable gap in the financial oversight and control framework.  Notwithstanding the described division of labor, the SFC works within the Executive branch of government - however given Brazil#s well developed federal system of government, it is unclear whether SFC#s role is limited to the audit of federal agencies while the audit of sub-national governments receiving federal funding are subject to audits carried out by a sub-national entity (e.g., Tribunal de Contas do Estado or State Secretaria de Controle). The situation is further complicated by the fact that the internal audit units of federal ministries and the internal audit units of sub-national government secretariats also lack clarity vis-\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\xa0-vis their respective roles and responsibilities for the oversight of federally funded programs within the respective agencies and at different levels of government. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2009-05-14\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2009-05-14\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-09-30\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-06-19\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Joseph Kizito Mubiru</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Practice Manager</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>jkizito@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"BR\">     <narrative>BRAZIL</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15111\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public finance management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2009-05-14\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-09-30\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">349561.89 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">349561.89  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P109826\">\\n       <narrative>BRAZIL</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">349561.89  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P109826\">\\n       <narrative>BRAZIL</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:40:14\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P109836</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>M&amp;E for MDGS through Innovative Censuses</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>The main objective of this grant would be to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through the promotion and effective use of innovative practices in the 2010 round of population and housing censuses.

This initiative would allow the majority of the countries in the LAC region to become versed and experienced in the more effective tools of innovative censuses to both strengthen the voice of the population and bolster the use of this information.  By doing so, this project will be able to maximize the experiences of the countries that are more advanced in this area, principally through South-South learning, to the greater benefit of the countries in the region. through the promotion and effective use of innovative practices in the 2010 round of population and housing censuses in nine countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, and Uruguay) that have explicitly requested technical assistance in this area. These countries initially presented a proposal to DFID to support of these activities, which DFID was unable to fund.  Nonetheless, given the importance of the proposal and the strong country-level commitment, DFID suggested that the countries present the proposal to the IDF, which supports projects in this vein.

THEY NEED FUNDING FOR THREE KEY ASPECTS: REGULATION AS PER NEW LAW REGARDING (A) SELECTION OF CONSULTANTS AND METHODS OF CIVIL WORKS AND GOODS PROCUREMENT; (B) CREATION OF A NEW UNIFIED BIDDER REGISTRATION SYSTEM AND (C) SUPPORTING CINCO\\'S ROLE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REFORMED LAW  The ultimate development purpose of the grant would be to guarantee a faster and smooth implementation of the new procurement regulation and try to avoid the paralysis that may be created by the lack of knowledge of those in charge to apply the new rules, in the implementation of projects that require procurement actions. The reform is introducing rules that changed dramatically the way procurement has been carried out in the last 15 years in Colombia. As example of the new modalities introduced by the new regulation, this is the first country in the region introducing quality as the selection method for selection of consultants; inclusion of lowest evaluated bid as criteria to award civil works and goods contracts; introducing the reverse auctions for procurement of common goods and include the possibility of framework contracts, among others. For Colombian procurement officers and private actors  it will be a challenging period if they do not received rapid training and guidance because there is not reference on how to implement the new methods and rules. Focusing on the implementation of the new regulation will accelerate the actions to strengthen procurement system, increasing the efficiency and making it more predictable. The Colombian congress opted for making the new law mandatory since its promulgation without a timeframe for training purposes. It makes urgent the need of help the Government on this purpose.  As documented by the Banks assessment, the Colombian procurement system needed this reform in order to make it more efficient, transparent and reliable. The new law 1150 has already broken significant ground but challenges remain, particularly for its implementation. Tackling these challenges could place Colombia at the forefront of Latin American on public procurement best practices and significantly closing the gap with Bank#s policies.  As background information, the legal framework consists of Law 80 of 1993 and 1150 of 2007 and around 80 regulatory decrees and other laws. Over-regulated public procurement introduced opportunities for corruption. Over-regulation and the high concern with corruption led to an environment of mutual distrust between the government and those doing business with it. Also, there was no system to monitor and evaluate procurement practices.  Under this scenario, the Bank, though the Modernization of the Financial Public Administration II Project helped strengthen the procurement systems. This subcomponent of the project (a) developed legislation and regulations to support modifications to the Procurement and Contracting (Law 80) with a view to improve the legal framework for public procurement; (b) designed and implemented institutional arrangements for developing and regulating public procurement and contracting policy; (c) developed and implemented a system for monitoring and evaluation of procurement and contracting practices in the public sector; (d) designed and implemented an internet based public procurement information system aimed at disseminating all information regarding procurement practices; and (e) carried out a survey to determined procurement training needs and developing a pedagogical system for providing public sector personnel with learning tools relating to the conceptual, technical, legal and procedural aspects of public procurement and contracting.  There were two areas that the MAFP II was not able to finance: (i) to finalize the institutionalization of the public procurement system and (ii) to finalize the regulation process as ordered in the law 1150 that  reformed law 80 (Public Procurement Legal Framework. With its careful work over the last two years, the Bank has earned a place as a trusted advisor for this reform, which has lead to the governments request for this IDF grant.  The National Planning Department through CINCO (Commission Inter-sectorial of Public Procurement) has an important convening role in the reform process. It has been the leader of this process and has been able to obtain public and private sector support for the transformation of the procurement system. At this point, it is crucial that CINCO continues finalizing this task. Approving the new law should be seen as a very important achievement but implementing the reform is perhaps even more important. This task cannot be left to Ministries and Agencies that are not familiar with the new procedures since they did not participate in the process. The whole process can be in jeopardy if the implementation fails to accomplish what was foreseen when the reform was proposed.  On a technical level, however, CINCO should identify focal points that, in the future, will support the reform and disseminate the knowledge require to use the new tools and procedures created by the law.  Once the reform is implemented with IDF support the knowledge would be shared with other countries, with the aim of documenting lessons learned, facilitating replication and ultimately resulting in more harmonization. With the full implementation of Law 1150 and with the institutionalization of the procurement system, it will become one of the region\\'s best practices. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2009-01-15\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2009-01-15\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-07-15\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-06-22\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Diomedes Berroa</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Practice Manager</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>dberroa@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"CO\">     <narrative>COLOMBIA</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public sector policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2009-01-15\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-07-15\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">328742.58 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">328742.58  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P109841\">\\n       <narrative>COLOMBIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">328742.58  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P109841\">\\n       <narrative>COLOMBIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:40:20\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P109882</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Lesotho Institute of Accountants- Capacity Development</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>Capacity building of LIA members in:  *   anti-fraud and anti-corruption responses *   Public Finance Management *   income tax planning and assessment Implementation of a QA program by LIA Amendment of the Accountants Act Overall program coordination The objective of the project is to develop the capacity of the Lesotho Institute of Accountants (#LIA#) and enable it to better meet the needs of its stakeholders, including, inter alia: (i) establishment of an improved qualification requirement for its members with respect to fraud and corruption issues, public finance management and tax planning and assessment;

First and more broadly, the proposal examines the conditions necessary to create a functioning market for LG capacity building which addresses issues of fragmentation, duplication and unmet demands. Secondly and more specifically, it will review the structure and functions of LGA, with a view to move it away from being a training provider towards a greater oversight and coordinating role. The Department of Interior and Local Government(DILG)and the Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) fully support this shift in the role of LGA from being a provider of training to a knowledge broker, leading to improved coordination and harmonization in capacity building interventions.  In addition, this activity would have a direct impact on the proposed Bank assistance for a Performance Grant System (FY09 deliverable) - which will provide development grants to LGUs that meet prescribed performance criteria, or provide capacity building grants to LGUs that fail to meet performance criteria (in order that they may qualify for development grants in later rounds). The proposal supports the 2006-2008 CAS objective of improving the capacity of public institutions and services to deliver on its social contract with its citizens and thus help the country achieve its development potential.  The CAS identifies two important levers for pursuing economic growth and social inclusion, namely, fiscal stability and improving governance.  This will occur at three levels of engagement, i.e. national, local and private sector.  Although the ultimate development objective is to improve the capacity of local governments in order to increase the likelihood of better outcomes across all services delivered by LGUs, the proposal identifies the LGA as the direct recipient of technical assistance given its potentially important role in creating a functioning market place for LGU capacity building as well as the development of a performance framework that is consistent across projects. It is noted that coordination and oversight are already part of LGA\\'s existing mandate. Linking financing and capacity building to a clear performance framework in a practical way will also facilitate good governance at the local level. Capacity building to improve local government unit (LGU) competencies under decentralization remains a key development challenge for the Philippines. Although there is a large number of training institutions providing LGU training, the effectiveness of these programs is undermined by fragmentation, duplication, and lack of adequate coordination and oversight. This has resulted in poorly targeted training programs, and a mismatch between demand and supply of training. The proposed IDF grant aims to improve the institutional framework for the delivery of LGU capacity building initiatives by: (a) enhancing the role of the Local Government Academy (LGA) in the coordination and oversight of a highly fragmented market for LGU training; (b) enhancing LGA capacity to manage an updated inventory of LGU training activities/resources, and make this accessible to LGUs and training providers; and (c) conducting an exploratory study on the institutional requirements for launching a professional certification program for LGU staff linked to civil service reform. This will build on the dialogue already underway between the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the Civil Service Commission (CSC), and competence assessments funded under other programs. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-09-18\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-09-18\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-11-18\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-10-15\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Evangeline Kim Cuenco</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Short Term Consultant</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"PH\">     <narrative>PHILIPPINES</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"50.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public sector policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector> <sector code=\"15112\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"50.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Decentralisation and support to subnational government]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-09-18\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-11-18\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">177582.32 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">177582.32  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P109906\">\\n       <narrative>PHILIPPINES</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">177582.32  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P109906\">\\n       <narrative>PHILIPPINES</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><document-link format=\"application/pdf\" url=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/978401468285562168/pdf/ISR-Disclosable-P109906-11252012-1353869556875.pdf\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<title xml:lang=\"en\"><narrative>Implementation Status and Results Report</narrative></title><category code=\"A07\"/><category code=\"A08\"/></document-link><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/><result type=\"2\" aggregation-status=\"0\">\\n<title><narrative>\\n PDO Indicator \\n</narrative></title>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<indicator measure=\"5\" ascending=\"1\">\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<title><narrative>\\nCertification system for municipal/ city professional cadre\\n</narrative></title> \\n<baseline year=\"2008\" iso-date=\"2008-02-25\" value=\"No certification system in place for municipal/cit\"><comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<narrative/></comment></baseline>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<period>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<period-start iso-date=\"2008-02-25\"/>  <period-end iso-date=\"2012-09-18\"/>\\n<target value=\"Certification study completed;

A feasibility study has been commissionned. The results have been endorsed by the Head of States during the last CEMAC Meeting (Q2 2007). CEMAC has been identified as focal point to facilitate the preparation and implementation of the project. CEMAC capacity is limited. The institution will handdle complex and important procurement of goods for multiple countries. Also, accurate and timely reporting will probably be key (and is to date inexistant). The grant will support the following activities to assist CEMAC: - Legal Reforms - (i) Conduct Telecom and ICT legal assessment in CEMAC Countries to identify key legal and regulatory reforms needed to establish Regional Telecom backbones/ Regional operators; (ii) Draft Guidelines/ Recommandations to adapt legal and regulatory framework to modify existing framework; (iii) Organize a regional workshop in Bangui on Assessment and proposed Guidelines. - Procurement -  (i) Conduct an assessment on National Procurement Laws on how a Regional Infastructure could be procured; (ii) Make recommendations to faciliate procurement of such infrastructure; (iii) capacity building at the CEMAC Secretariat to handdle such procurement. - Monitoring &amp; Evaluation - (i) Conduct an assessment of existing M&amp;E systems and capacity in the telecom and IT sector at the Country level for CEMAC Countries; (ii) Develop a M&amp;E system and benchmark indicators for the sector at the Regional level (to monitor Regional progress for the sector and such project) to be shared/implemented with National representatives; (iii) Organize a regional workshop on this subject in Yaound\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\xa9. The grant will strengthen the Telecom legal and institutional environment of CEMAC Region and improve the Telecom and Information Technology  representation/visibility to increase regional telecommunications and Information Technology (IT) investments. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-10-20\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-10-20\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-04-19\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-04-26\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Jerome Bezzina</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Digital Development Specialist\\nGG</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>jbezzina@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"2\"/> <recipient-region code=\"298\">   <narrative>Africa regional</narrative>\\n       </recipient-region> <sector code=\"22020\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"70.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Telecommunications]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector> <sector code=\"22040\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"30.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Information and communication technology (ICT)]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-10-20\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-04-19\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">469449.28 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">469449.28  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P109923\">\\n       <narrative>Africa, regional</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">469449.28  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P109923\">\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:40:30\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P110394</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Strengthening Internal Audit and Revamping of the Accounts Training Schools of the Government of Madhya Pradesh</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>    Objectives of Proposed Activity: The objective of proposed project is to complete studies on internal audit functions and working of the accounts training institutes to impart training to persons at the cutting edge of the system. It also envisages suggesting the approach to carry out the improvements in these areas. The Government of Madhya Pradesh has already embarked on streamlining financial procedures and rules and implementing electronic treasury procedures, the proposed study will extend and deepen the process already initiated by Government.       10. Description of activity:                                                          Under the control of The Finance Department, the Directorate of Treasuries and Accounts is entrusted with the responsibilities of administration of Treasuries, Cadre management, Internal Audit of Departments (other than local bodies and corporations), Financial Management, Training and Generation of MIS to support Financial Planning. All this is performed with the help of field level offices including 53 Treasuries, 160 Sub-Treasuries, 07 divisional offices and 07 Account Training Schools(ATS).               The responsibility of audit of Urban Local Bodies (ULB\\'s), Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI\\'s), Universities and various corporations/boards lies with the Directorate of Insurance and Local Fund. There are 07 divisional offices under this Directorate; the directorate is located at Gwalior. Besides keeping records of various Insurance schemes launched by the State Government for benefits of employees, this Directorate also conducts Resident audit and post audit of the above-mentioned offices,               The Project activities will be divided into the following work streams: - (A)   Study the scope of enhancing quality of audit and Capacity building of the auditors to improve performance, adaptation of IA standards, and policies, including audit of Urban Local Bodies (ULB\\'s) and  Panchayati Raj Institutes (PRI\\'s) with especial emphasis on IT audit. (B) Analyze the training needs of Accounts Training Schools and suggest the approach to develop them as training and research centers of excellence and carry out the improvements possible within project period. (A)  The current function of internal audit is often not effective enough to cater to the needs of the fast changing scenario of liberalization in every field. Therefore, the GoMP needs to improve its current internal audit functions as well as the audit procedures of ULB\\'s and PRI\\'s. Evaluating the existing internal audit procedures/ manual and developing general audit procedure manual for Government departments/ public sector undertakings/ corporations and bodies is the need of the hour. Moreover there is a strong need of capacity building of the auditors in the State by means of participation in various workshops and training in best International and National institutes. (B) Across departments personnel at the grassroots level responsible for the maintenance of accounts are essentially clerks who are often not exposed to any meaningful accounts training. The only institutions to impart accounts training to these personnel are Accounts Training. Schools (currently 7 in numbers). There is a need to impart advanced specialized training, for technical and non-technical personnel. To ensure consistent optimum performance of the system, the current syllabus of accounts training needs revamping. Modules on Budget, Store Management, Cash &amp; Account, Audit &amp; Inspection, Office Procedures and Basic Computer Applications may be introduced in the curriculum of ATS. There is a need to develop customized training modules for Panchayati Raj Institutions, Urban Local Bodies, Civil Society Organizations and NGOs. Under the proposed project all these needs can be studied and methodology for improvements may be suggested. Accordingly necessary curriculum will be developed and  Hardware/Software will be procured and Accounts Training Schools will be developed as model schools. Almost all the Public Financial Management &amp; Accountability  (PFMA) System assessments undertaken by the Bank at the sub-national level in India have consistenly observed the lack of an efficient internal audit system. The current function of internal audit entrusted with the Directorate of Treasuries and Accounts in the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GoMP) is no exception to the situation prevalent elsewhere in India at the sub-national level. The Internal audit function in GoMP is  limited to auditing individual transactions as opposed to periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the internal control systems and   governance processes. Thus there is a strong need for strengthening the internal audit function in the State.  With recent modernization in the State treasury systems and steady transition towards better standards in financial management in the State, there is also an acute need for revamping the Accounts Training Schools of the Government  The objective of this Grant is to assist the Government of Madhya Pradesh  (1) in  strengthening  internal audit through institutional restructuring, adoption of internal audit standards and implementation guidelines and exposure of the government internal auditors to best practices through classroom and on-the-job training and (2) Revampingthe training facilities available in the State for imparting training in Finance functions. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-09-19\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-09-19\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-03-31\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-02-13\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Papia Bhatachaarji</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Financial Management Specialist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>pbhatachaarji@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"IN\">     <narrative>INDIA</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15111\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public finance management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:40:33\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P110527</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Support for the Accountancy Profession in Cote d\\'Ivoire</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative> The main objectives of this IDF is to enhance the capacity of Accountancy Professional in Cote d\\'Ivoire to more effectively carry out its function.

All of this would result in enhancing the quality of the accounting and auditing profession and financial accountability and governance in Cote d\\'Ivoire. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2010-06-03\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2010-06-03\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2013-09-24\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2013-09-16\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Saidou Diop</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Lead Governance Specialist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>dsaidou@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC -

To support the Procurement Service in the implementation of the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System, PhilGEPS, and ensure its acceptability for procurement in projects assisted by multilateral development banks (MDBs).  The proposed IDF for PhilGEPS will support the implementation of the Procurement Law\\'s mandate for transparency and modernization of the public procurement system, thus, contributing to the reduction of procurement corruption. This is the ultimate objective of the Procurement Reform Law, as an anti-corruption measure.  The Government Procurement Reform Act (GPRA, RA9184) mandated the use of PhilGEPs as the single, centralized electronic portal for all government agencies in the procurement of common-use goods.  PhilGEPs is also meant to serve as a central portal providing the primary source of information on the status of procurement of other goods and general support services, civil works, and consulting services.  After a year of implementation of the new PhilGEPS, the most notable issues that have arisen are problems and delays associated with the creation and posting of awards notices and the need for additional training.  While access to the system is not limited, not all agencies of the government submit information to PhilGEPS, or avail themselves of its services, particularly in the posting of information on contract awards.  A pilot electronic procurement system had been established in Nov. 2000, with the assistance of CIDA, but there have been problems with the system of awards because suppliers need to register in the system in order to participate in the bidding process and receive an award.  In some cases, suppliers participated in the bids through a manual process and were subsequently neither identified in the electronic system nor could they be identified after the bid had closed.  Whereas the pilot system supported the issuance of multiple awards for different lots of a bid without any restrictions on the structure of the original notices, the new system requires the agency to identify multiple lots in the original notice upfront in order to assign multiple awards to the different lots at the time of award.  In view of the importance of the promotion of transparency and efficiency in the conduct of public procurement through the use of information and communications technology, a proposal for an IDF grant financing is hereby being made to help strengthen the capacity of the Procurement Service in the implementation of PhilGEPs.  However, as the magnitude of the work involved is such that not all tasks/activities can be funded from the IDF grant, the work proposed to be funded from the IDF grant is geared more towards the institutionalization of the system, and the Procurement Service has taken these into consideration in the request for funding.  The possibility of tapping the Korea trust fund for other tasks have been discussed with the Asian Development Bank, but nothing concrete has resulted to date. The IDF focuses on institutional development and strengthening, and the project is in reality strengthening of PhilGEPS Unit of Procurement Service as the only electronic Government Procurement in the country.  The Korean Grant, however is not focused on institutional strengthening but more on capacity building or training. Moreover, the Korean TF, altough untied, would be keen to demonstrate Korean development experience in IT and other fields.  The PhilGEPS is modeled after the Canadian eGP, and that would not match. There is no duplication of activities between the IDF and the proposed ADB Korean TF for funding purposes. The latter will fund the downstream activities. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-06-25\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-06-25\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-12-25\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-01-04\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Rene SD.

In particular the project seeks to assist the Secretariat of the INDS within the Prime Ministry to establish a full-fledged monitoring and evaluation system. This includes:  - ensuring a better management and coordination of the INDS process through developing a framework for monitoring and evaluation of the actvities in the context of the INDS which allows for an improved flow of information between all relevant Minsitries and implementing agencies. - the development of relevant performance and poverty indicators. - statistical capacity building to improve the production of stastistics (quantitative and qualitative) across relevant Ministries -  hands-on training in data generation, analysis and reporting of information to monitor the implementation, evaluate the ouctomes and track general poverty and sector performance trends. - support in stakeholder consultations and concertation of entities involved in the implementation of INDS activities. The overall objective of this project is to help the government of Djibouti to establish and operationalize a effective Monitoring and Evaluation system for their National Initiative for Social Development (practically a second generation PRSP) with a specific focus on monitoring poverty, social, and economic outcomes of the initiative. In particular, the proposed project seeks to enhance the institutional and technical capacities and competencies of staff in the INDS secretariat as well as of focal points in all line Ministries and agencies concerned with the implementation of the INDS.  Background  In January 2007 Djibouti\\'s government launched the national initiative for social development (INDS), designed after the Moroccan model for poverty alleviation (INDH). This initiative represents a second generation PRSP. It was designed in recognition of the shortcomings of the first PRSP which did not produce the desired outcomes to overcome the deep structural problems of poverty and income inequality. Its major objective is to reduce poverty by promoting access to basic social services and improve the quality and effectiveness of delivery. It further aims at modernizing the economic production process to alleviate the high unemployment rates, estimated at 60% of the available labor force.  The social and economic development process is at a turning point since the launch of the INDS which is widely regarded as a reference framework for all development efforts in the country. As a first step, the government agreed on an action plan, prepared with the help of the World Bank and UNDP, that includes milestones for 2007-11. In order to implement the INDS, several programs and institutions have been already merged and re-structured. A permanent secretariat was established at the Prime Ministry that will be in charge of monitoring the implementation of the INDS and to coordinate all efforts among the different actors.  Building on the experiences of the first PRSP, the INDS set the following priority actions in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the implementation:  - Making the INDS operational and actionable in consultation with all stakeholders  -  Establishing an integrated system of planning and management of public finances.  -  Improvement planning instruments and developing a system for effective monitoring and evaluation.  -  Strengthening the capacities needed for the implementation of the INDS in all Ministries involved.  -  Accelerating structural reforms and reinforcing good governance.  A recent Bank assessment of the PRSP 2004-06 highlighted that the lack of proper monitoring and evaluation tools and mechanisms hampered the effective implementation of the PRSP. The recognition of this weakness led to the prioritization of monitoring and evaluation in the context of the INDS.  Very basic monitoring capacities exist in different line Ministries but are not sufficient to effectively monitor the various public spending programs. Over the past year, the INDS secretariat (Secretariat Technique Permanent de l\\'INDS - STP) began to improve the M&amp;E system based on the recommendations of a M&amp;E strategy developed in 2004 within the framework of the first PRSP. This strategy was never implemented. The proposed M&amp;E architecture is still largely appropriate for the purpose of the INDS, however, some refinements are needed in order to reflect the recent institutional changes and the scope of the INDS which is broader than the first PRSP. Extending the M&amp;E system to all relevant public entities concerned with the implementation of the INDS and making it fully operationable is one of the biggest challenges the government has to meet to reach the objectives of the INDS. The outcomes of this project will have implications beyond the INDS: First, the enhanced M&amp;E capacity developed will help in the implementation of other public spending programs - particularly pertinent in the health and education sector where M&amp;E capacities are weak but very relevant. Second, it will help to generate new sector specific information that is presently not available and better inform decision making.  And third, it can provide a basis for performance-based budget management should the government decide to move into this direction.  The primary beneficiary and counterpart of this project is the INDS secretariat (Secretariat Technique Permanent de l\\'INDS - STP) within the Prime Ministry. However, the project will involve and benefit all focal points in line Ministries and agencies involved in the implementation of the INDS.  The proposed project directly covers one of the focus areas of the Institutional Development Fund - Results-oriented monitoring and evaluation. All proposed activities meet the eligibility criteria and represent good practice in that they will strengthen the incentive system for M&amp;E, build capacity in all relevant Ministries, strengthen data analysis and production and foster dialogue and exchange with the civil society. A baseline (country) diagnostic will be prepared prior to the IDF project through a BB financed TA activity. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-08-10\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-08-10\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-08-10\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2013-07-26\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Sherine Hassan Mahmoud Alshawarby</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Short Term Consultant</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"DJ\">     <narrative>DJIBOUTI</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public sector policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-08-10\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-08-10\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">275787.86 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">275787.86  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P110722\">\\n       <narrative>DJIBOUTI</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">275787.86  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P110722\">\\n       <narrative>DJIBOUTI</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:40:47\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P110725</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Morocco Support for Improved Public Expenditure Management (MTEF)</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>Morocco: Support for Improved Public Expenditure Management (MTEF)  Activities to be financed by the IDF grant:  It is crucial to create the necessary conditions for a sound implementation of the reform measures already taken as well as preparing the grounds for the continuation of the reform process, and, in this regard, to build and strengthen capacity of the ministries both at the central level as well as at local level. This IDF Grant is meant to support the implementation of the PARP reforms, especially the preparation of MTEFs. To that effect, the IDF Grant would finance in sequence the following activities: (i) capacity building in the MOF to prepare macroeconomic framework and aggregate MTEF; and (ii) capacity building in the central and decentralized services in the field of MTEFs preparation of key selected ministries. The objective of this IDF grant is to build and strengthen institutional capacities within selected ministries (5-6 ministries), both at the central level and in their de-concentrated branches, so that sectoral Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF) can be prepared in the selected ministries and become the central tool for the preparation of sectoral budgets.  Building institutional capacities in the selected ministries in the field of MTEFs preparation will help introduce performance-based, multiyear perspectives budgeting process in line with the goals of the on-going budget reform (BR) to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in public spending leading to performance-oriented management, good governance and transparent institutional development.  The MTEF is being introduced as a three-year moving budgeting process putting the budget management in a multiyear perspective. By introducing such a tool, the government is seeking to strengthen the sustainability of the public policies by aligning their future budgetary impacts with provisional financial resources of the State and the macroeconomic constraints. It also aims at improving the inter-sector resource allocations through a better delineation of policies into programs/activities in the annual budgets, and improving operational performance of public service delivery. The latter would be the outcome of an enhanced visibility of line managers in managing their programs and the use of a performance-monitoring framework of public expenditures.  In the preparation for the launching of the of MTEF process, the Government organized two seminars in April 2006 and in April 2007 with the support of the World Bank through P-ESW instrument. The seminars have provided opportunity to disseminate the MTEF methodology and international best practices to all ministries. The P-ESW also supported the preparation of a Methodological Guide for the preparation of MTEFs adapted to the institutional and regulatory conditions of the country. Subsequently, following the successful preparation of pilot MTEFs for 2007-2009 by the ministries of National Education, Housing, Health, and Equipment, the Prime Minister officially launched in February 2007 the process of MTEFs preparation. So far, a total of 9 out of 34 ministries have prepared draft sectoral MTEFs for 2008-10. To help extend the preparation of MTEFs to the remaining ministries, the Government requested Bank support in the form of technical assistance and training.  Several factors are expected to concur in ensuring the sustainability of the proposed institutional capacity building. First, budget reform, including the MTEF preparation process, is a key component of the Public Administration Reform Program (PARP) launched by Morocco in 2002. The steady implementation of the PARP has been set as a priority by the Government, which demonstrated increasing ownership of the reform, creating the necessary momentum and conditions towards achieving its intended objectives.  As of now, almost all the ministries have structured their projects to comply with the results-based program budgeting process, which entitled them to benefit from some flexibility in the reallocation of non-salary resources within programs. Second, the process of MTEFs preparation has been recognized by the Government as an essential mechanism for improving the inter- and intra-sectoral allocation of resources in line with Government policies and priorities. In this regard, a Prime Minister Ordinance has been disseminated to all ministerial departments urging them to prepare MTEFs according to the related Methodological Guide. Third, the PARP in general and the BR in particular are being supported by the World Bank through DPLs and specific P-ESW activities. Two DPLs have been awarded in 2004 and 2006, and a third is expected to be signed in mid-2008. In addition, P-ESW supported two seminars to disseminate the MTEF methodology and the preparation of a Methodological Guide. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-06-23\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-06-23\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2011-12-23\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2011-10-27\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Khalid El Massnaoui</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Short Term Consultant</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"MA\">     <narrative>MOROCCO</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15110\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"33.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public sector policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector> <sector code=\"15111\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"67.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public finance management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-06-23\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2011-12-23\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">323480.00 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">323480.00  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P110725\">\\n       <narrative>MOROCCO</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">323480.00  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P110725\">\\n       <narrative>MOROCCO</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:40:50\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P110734</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>IDF - Vietnam Capacity Strengthening for the Vietnam Association of Certified Public Accountants</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative> The project will have three components: Component 1 Building and Training in Sample Audit Programs: This component will support the engagement of an international expert and local audit practitioners to work with the VACPA staff and advisory members to developing a sample audit program(s) for financial statements audits based on the legal regulations in Vietnam, the Vietnam Accounting Standards (VAS) and the Vietnamese Standards of Auditing (VSA). The consultants will also assist and help develop training materials to enable the VACPA to provide professional development training to auditors. Support will also be provided for consultations with audit membership on the sample audit programs and for document translation and printing.  The VACPA will use to enhance the understanding and knowledge of auditors. Seven training courses using the sample audit program will be delivered with the assistance of trainers from local financial training centres to practicing auditors (approximately 100 auditors per course with a focus on practitioners of small and medium size audit firms). The expected outcome is improved quality of auditing services through Vietnamese auditors have access to a credible guidance on standard financial statements audit program(s) and for the program(s) to be a benchmark for the quality assurance monitoring by the VACPA and the Ministry of Finance. Component 2 Training in the application of VAS and VSA In Vietnam 26 accounting standards (VAS) and 36 auditing have been issued (VSA), however surveys of financial statements and audit reports by the VACPA and Ministry of Finance indicate that some of the more technically complex standards are not being properly applied. Feedback from CPA members to the VACPA indicates the need for guidance and training in the proper application of the VAS and VSA to improve the quality and consistency of financial reporting and of auditing.  This component will address this immediate high priority need through supporting the engagement of a small team of local audit experts to work with the VACPA to design and develop Guidelines on the technically challenging VAS and VSA (a total of 10 priority standards have been identified). To ensure quality guidance notes and training materials are produced, the component will provide funding support for consultations within the professions (workshops, peer reviews). Five (5) two day training courses for certified public accountants and auditors will be conducted to disseminate the guidance notes by Vietnam accounting and auditing lecturers. The expected outcome is improved knowledge and understanding of accountants and auditors on the application of the standards. The outputs of the component will be Technical Guidance Notes and associated training materials on the 10 technically complex VAS and VSA; approximately 500 professional accountants and auditors trained. Component 3 Institutional Development for the Association The VACPA is the professional association for certified practicing auditors of Vietnam. The VACPA has approximately 600 CPA members and 140 firms registered to provide audit services in Vietnam.  The VACPA members and audit firms are required to renew their memberships and have continuing professional development obligations. The VACPA also manages the annual audit quality assurance review program. The VACPA, as a very young professional body, has yet to develop its internal systems and methods of operation to effectively manage its membership and activities. This component will support a study tour for 7 of the VACPA executive and staff to visit the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore (ICPAS) to gain an understanding of the software systems used for managing members and association activities. The expected outcome is a roadmap for the future acquisition and implementation of systems at the VACPA to improve its management of its members and activities. Component 4 Project Implementation and Audit This component will support the engagement of one technical expert and one coordinator to work with the VACPA to help the Association coordinate and manage the consultants in the development of technical guidance and training materials and to help coordinate consultations with members on the content of the audit programs, accounting and auditing guidance notes.  They will also carry out the logistics for arranging the training to be delivered. This component will also support acquisition of computer and presentation equipment to support the development of audit program(s) and the delivery of training by the VACPA.  It will also fund the cost of audit of the IDF grant. The development objective of this IDF proposal is to build the capacity of the professional accountants and auditors in Vietnam through assisting the Vietnam Association of Certified Practicing Accountants and Auditors (VACPA) to (i) develop and train in standard financial statements audit program(s) for practicing auditors and for use as a benchmark in annual quality assurance monitoring of auditors; (ii) develop Technical Guidance Notes and associated training materials on the technically complex Vietnam Accounting Standards and Vietnam Standards of Auditing and deliver training to professional accountants and auditors; and (iii) develop an understanding and a roadmap for implementing systems to effectively manage its membership and association activities. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-10-29\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-10-29\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-04-28\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-03-15\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Cung Van Pham</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Financial Management Specialist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>cpham@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"VN\">     <narrative>VIET NAM</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"24010\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Financial policy and administrative management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-10-29\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-04-28\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">226655.92 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">226655.92  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P110734\">\\n       <narrative>VIET NAM</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">226655.92  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P110734\">\\n       <narrative>VIET NAM</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:40:53\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P110743</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Arab World - Public Engagement in Water Management</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative> To support the Arab Water Council raise awareness of water issues around the Arab world. 02/07/07.

the African Union Commission</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative> This program seeks to facilitate capacity of the African Union (AU)specifically the AU\\'s Representational mission in the United States of America (in Washington, DC) to carry out its core functions which include (a) developing, maintaining, and undertaking resource mobilization, and (b) building constructive and productive institutional relationships with the African Diaspora and international institutions, multilateral and bilateral and other development partners in the Americas such as the Bretton Woods Institutions, the Government of the US, African Diasporas in the Americas, and the Organization of American States. This program seeks to enhance capacity of the African Union (AU), specifically the AU\\'s Representational Mission to the United States of America (in Washington, DC), to carry out its core functions of developing and maintaining productive institutional relationships with the African Diaspora in the Americas.  Outcomes  The program will contribute to the following outcomes:  . Strengthened knowledge sharing capacity of the AU Representational Mission with Diasporas and development partners in the Americas;  .    Development of a reliable Database of African Diaspora networks and individuals;  .    Initiation of resource mobilization efforts from the African Diaspora and private sector in the Americas;  .    Improved coordination with the African Diaspora in the Americas (North America, the Caribbean, and Latin America);  .     Enhanced capacity of the AUC to participate in meetings with international, bilateral and multilateral institutions, and other global dialogues on the African Diaspora.  Background  The AU, African governments, the World Bank Group, and other development partners of Africa have realized that the African Diaspora (\"peoples of African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union\") must become full partners in the continent\\'s development.  The AU has begun taking the steps necessary for harnessing the expertise and resources of African Diasporas as the sixth (6th) \"region.\" The AU established a Representational Mission to the United States of America with an Ambassador (in Washington, DC).  This Mission has as its primary role, helping to mobilize African Diasporas for the continent\\'s development.  The Mission is currently staffed with one Resident Representative, who is supported by a small core staff, and basic office facilities and tools.  The World Bank launched its Mobilizing the African Diaspora for Development initiative in September 2007. This initiative is embedded in the Capacity Development in Africa: Management Action Plan (CDMAP) which was approved by the Board in September 2006, and which states \"... Moving beyond capacity building to capacity development and retention will require an unrelenting focus on unleashing, nurturing, and retaining the existing capacity and better use of local and Diaspora talent\" (page 1, para 2 of CDMAP). The main pillars of the Mobilizing the African Diaspora for Development initiative are to work with:  . The African Union Commission (AUC) and provide technical support to its African Diaspora program.  . Partner country governments to: find ways of engaging the Diaspora in the design and implementation of the on-going portfolio of World Bank-assisted projects, and in the planned pipeline of proposed new World Bank-assisted projects; and to assist in creating the \"enabling environments\" for Diaspora engagement including policies and programs affecting return, retention, virtual participation/contributions and investment in development.  . Development Partners and others to establish a multi-donor African Diaspora Engagement and Facilitation Fund (ADEFF) to provide grants and technical assistance support to Diaspora organizations, networks, and communities for Diaspora-led development projects and programs to be implemented in African countries.  . The African Development Bank to establish and support a Diaspora Remittance Investment based on global experiences and initiatives that exploit the benefits of Diaspora remittances for in-country investments for development.  . Diaspora organizations and professionals, donor agencies, and African Governments to share knowledge and improve communication among and between all parties with the objective of enhancing Diaspora contributions to development.  The proposed IDF financing is being requested to strengthen the Representational Mission to acquire the capacity for interacting seamlessly with AU Member State Missions in the Americas, the African Diaspora and international, multilateral and bilateral institutions and other development partners in the Americas. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-07-15\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-07-15\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-07-15\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2013-07-18\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Soheyla Razaghi Mahmoudi</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Short Term Consultant</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC -

Development Objective To promote good governance and public service delivery through supporting public procurement reforms to enhance the quality of procurement outcomes in terms of: higher volumes, efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and better value for money. Link to CAS and/or ESW (core diagnostics, e.g., CPAR, CFAA, PER, CEM, etc.), and relationship to Bank operations : According to the 2004 CAS, Nepal will have to undertake a number of governance reforms in order to stimulate a more pro-poor and inclusive growth process. The CAS stresses the significance of capacity building efforts in improving governance, and the role of efficient public procurement in the economy.  As recommended by the CPAR 2002, the Government of Nepal enacted a Public Procurement Law in 2007 along with Public Procurement Regulations, 2007. It is essential that these laws and regulations be fully implemented since the most recent assessment of the Nepal Public Financial Management System, the Public Financial Management Sector Work recently carried out jointly by the Government of Nepal and the World Bank, found once again that procurement performance remains a very significant issues and achieved a low rating (C) for value of money and controls in procurement.  The Government has a huge challenge to ensure effective implementation of the Law, and the Bank needs to continue its support and engagement in this sector. Work to implement the Procurement Law is completely in concert with the governance initiative as envisioned in the updated CAS 2007. To assist Government in preparing a strategy for and initiating actions to implement the public procurement law so as to enhance the quality of procurement outcomes in terms of: higher volumes, efficiency, optimum budget utilisation, effectiveness, transparency and better value for money which would lead to better governance and improved public service delivery. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-07-16\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-07-16\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-04-01\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-02-23\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Kiran Ranjan Baral</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Short Term Consultant</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"NP\">     <narrative>NEPAL</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"15111\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Public finance management]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-07-16\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-04-01\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">237238.14 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">237238.14  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P110760\">\\n       <narrative>NEPAL</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">237238.14  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P110760\">\\n       <narrative>NEPAL</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:41:03\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P110802</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Gabon - Capacity Building in Environment Management of Large Infrastructure Projects</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>    The IDF Grant aims at: (1) supporting the preparation of sector guidelines and the definition of norms and indicators, which will be used as substantial inputs for the revision of the EPC, (ii) training staff from MoE and line Ministries to the strengthen the environmental and social capacity at Governmental level to help it properly guide, assess, review and monitor environmental and social impact assessment processes and outcomes for large infrastructure projects and (iii) promote and strengthen the capacity of Civil Society\\'s Organizations (CSOs) and local communities to participate in the review and implementation of environmental and social assessments and management plans related large infrastructure projects, that could affect them. First Closing Date Dec. 15, 2011 The objective of the IDF grant is to strengthenthe Government of Gabon\\'s ability to review Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and monitor the implementation of Environmental Management Plans (EMP) for large infrastructure projects and to provide access to environment-related documentation.  As a matter of fact, large infrastructure projects (such as hydropower plants, exploitation of large iron-ore deposit, roads,#) are planned by the GoG to engage the transition from a highly oil dependent economy to a diversified one (cf Part on Relationship to country development program) these are promising opportunities and are likely to provide significant incomes to the country. However, very few large infrastructures have been created so far in Gabon (except the TransGabon railway) and challenges related to such projects are huge, specifically with regards to the integration of environmental safeguards. As a matter of fact, such large projects will have substantial environmental and social impacts which need to be carefully dealt with, through sound and effective environmental assessment and management plans in order to avoid, minimize and/or offset as appropriate their direct and indirect costs to Gabon and its populations.  With a national territory covering 267,667 square kilometers, Gabon has a very low population, highly concentrated in the major cities: 84% of the 1,529.919 inhabitants live in the major urban centers and 42% in the Capital Libreville (according to the latest census from the Ministry of Planning and Development in 1993). Most of the planned infrastructure projects will be implemented in #empty# areas and no displacement of population is foreseen. Major foreseen social impacts of such projects are linked to potential pollutions of air, water and soil, due to the use chemical products. Though there is quite a good knowledge on #green# environment, knowledge is very limited as far as the brown and grey environment are concerned: this is exactly what the proposed IDF would target.  In 2005, Gabon created the Ministry of Environment (MoE, established as a Vice-Prime Ministry) with a clear mandate to make the future economic development compatible with the Environment preservation. However, despite the creation of the Ministry of Environment (MoE) in 2005, activities on the ground to protect environment are still very insufficient. The major reasons are:  (i) the MoE is still weak and drastically lacks financial and human capacities  (ii) the Environmental Protection Code, adopted in 1993, is no longer appropriate and needs to be revised. Moreover, there is no tool and guidelines to ensure enforcement of regulations on the ground.  (iii) the coordination amongst the various governmental bodies involved in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP), is unsatisfactory and strongly constrains the decision-making and action processes.  (iv) Very few consultations and awareness campaigns led so far, to the benefit of the non governmental stakeholders: private sector, civil society (NGOs, associations), local authorities (mayors), media, and lawyers. Involvement of all stakeholders needs to be strengthened.  The IDF grant is part of wider framework of reforms launched by the Government of Gabon to ensure that the transition from a highly oil-dependent economy to a diversified economy will be carried out in an environmentally- and socially-sound manner.  First, in order to adjust the regulatory framework to the new environmental challenges and to clarify roles and responsibilities and ensure an improved integration of environmental concerns in all activities and projects, the MoE has recently launched a process of revision of the Environment Protection Code (EPC), as well as the related regulatory texts. The MoE has received a budgetary allocation of US$220,000 for the FY 2008 (Jan. to Dec. 2008) to complete this exercise. However, this budget allocation resources are not enough to cover all the activities planned under the reform process of the Environment management. This is why the support from the Bank has been requested.  As a matter of fact, in addition to that revision of the EPC, the MoE has identified major activities that need to be launched to ensure that the environmental and social impacts of infrastructure projects are properly assessed and their environment management plans are satisfactorily elaborated and monitored. These activities are proposed to be financed by the IDF grant and are the following:  (i)\\telaboration of tools to evaluate and monitor environmental impacts (sector guidelines and norms/indicators),  (ii)\\treinforcement of human capacities in the MoE and in line ministries on environment Monitoring &amp; Evaluation M&amp;E (HQ staff and field staff), and  (iii)\\tConsultation and Information to the civil society on environmental issues.  The IDF are not purely M&amp;E activities but will contribute to define the foundations of an M&amp;E system, by elaborating key tools and instruments and strengthening capacities of both the Administrations and the non-government actors. The IDF activities will not directly cover the development of an Environmental Monitoring Information System (EMIS). Setting up an EMIS at the national level is far too ambitious and requires investments that exceed an IDF grant. Nonetheless, the IDF grant will pave the way for the elaboration of such a system. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2009-04-15\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2009-04-15\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2013-06-15\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2013-06-26\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Salimata D.

To ensure greater impact of audit findings, the Grant will also assist in providing support on public disclosure aspects. Components/Activities include Component 1 Performance Auditing Sub-component 1.1 - Deepening Performance Audit Capabilities. This component will support OAG to(a) review the current performance audit methods in Thailand and compare these with INTOSAI and international practices in a number of  selected countries, and (b) provide formal and on-the-job training in performance auditing for a further audit staff to become trainers and audit supervisors on Performance Audits at regional level. Sub-component 1.2 - Expansion of Performance Audit scope. This component will support OAG to develop auditing methodologies and practices for inclusion of environmental audit within the performance audit that the OAG will be required to conduct in the future. Component 2 Procurement Audit This component will support the OAG to develop auditing methodologies and practices in Procurement Audit. This will involve learning from international best practices and developing a methodology relevant to the OAG\\'s method of operation and the Thailand environment. Component 3 - Audit Authority, Enforcement, and Sanctions This component will support the implementation of recommended actions to reform the institution to be more independent and effective. Component 4 Financial Audit Sub-component 4.1 - Financial Audit of State Enterprises. This sub-component will support the OAG to explore areas and improvement needed to enhance capacity and competencies to carry out effective financial audits and provide quality audit reports. As the OAG has limited capacity and knowledge to deal with large state enterprises , particularly those listed in Stock Exchange, this sub-component will also help OAG outsource yet audits and establish QA arrangement.

The IDF funded capacity development activities would respond to government requests that essentially reflect action 14 of the CDMAP: Adopting a results focus and strengthening country monitoring &amp; evaluation and national statistical data management systems. The IDF grant will help develop the capacity of the MOH, especially the national Malaria and HIV/AIDS programs to design and implement rigorous impact evaluations, to analyze baseline data and to feed baseline results back into the design of the public health interventions with the aim of improving their targeting efficiency and facilitating the generation of evidence on program effectiveness. Moreover, the IDF grant will improve administrative data systems and capacity for data analysis in order to meet the requirements for evidence-based policy planning. By the end of the grant, both the National Malaria Control Program and the national HIV/AIDS program will have designed and will be implementing rigorous impact evaluations that assess the effectiveness of their prioritized policy options. At every step of the policy learning cycle, training will be provided by a support team at the Bank, an advisory group of international experts on impact evaluation, public health and epidemiology and on an ongoing basis by locally based consultants. The IDF grant will develop the institutional capacity for evidence-based policy making at the Ministry of Health of Eritrea, enabling the ministry to use rigorous evidence on program effectiveness in its strategic policy planning.  The strategy of the proposed IDF grant is to develop client capacity through learning by doing. The Ministry of Health is currently pursuing impact evaluations in three prioritized programs (HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Reproductive Health) with the aim of obtaining evidence on the effectiveness of policy alternatives.  The IDF funding is requested to ensure that carrying out these impact evaluations will result in lasting capacity improvements. The objective is to put the ministry in a position to pursue self-defined policy learning agendas at its own capacity in the future.  For that purpose, this grant will improve the management and availability of statistical data and statistical skills for evidence-based policy making (Component 1), and build capacity for the use of impact evaluation and beneficiary analyses in policy planning (Component 2). Both components are closely interrelated and are going to be implemented simultaneously.  The proposed activities will strengthen the Ministry of Health in two dimensions:  1. By learning: Institutional capacity will be strengthened as a result of improved knowledge and information about the effectiveness of operational alternatives. By acquiring rigorous evidence on the causal impact of public health interventions, the Ministry of Health will arrive at a more robust results chain and a more meaningful monitoring of program performance.  2. Through learning by doing: By implementing a full cycle of evidence-based policy improvement in several priority sectors, the Ministry of Health will undergo a learning-by-doing process at the end of which it will have developed the capacity to identify, acquire and use scientific evidence that is needed for the dynamic improvement of its programs.  The IDF funded activities will provide training and support at different stages of the evidence-based policy planning cycle. This cycle consists of (1) identifying policy learning needs, (2) testing operational alternatives and (3) feeding the results back into the policy planning process. Depending on the success of this grant, the capacity building activities will be continued beyond its duration. Additional funding will be sought through a subsequent IDF grant or another source.  The expected outcomes of the IDF grant are:  (1) Improved availability of information and statistical skills in the health sector  (2) The Ministry of Health is pursuing its policy learning needs through the use of impact evaluation and scientific analysis on the targeting of its programs. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2009-01-22\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2009-01-22\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-07-22\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-09-12\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Rianna L.

This IDF proposal will support the implementation of part of this strategy in addition to improving financial corporate reporting and regulatory aspects of accounting in Cambodia. (1)   Component 1:Modernizing  Statutory Framework (NAC)       This will entail revision of accounting laws that currently guide accounting and   audit professions in Cambodia. It will also involve full adoption of IFRS, creating sustainable accounting and auditing standards setting structure by developing interim measures of transition and full adoption of the same. (2) Component 2: Capacity Building for Compliance with Accounting and Auditing standards (NAC)  This component will involve developing measures for enforcing auditing and accounting standards coupled with devising appropriate mechanisms of ensuring adherence to financial reporting requirements. It will also focus on building capacity within NBC, NAC and Finance and Industry within the Ministry of Economy and Finance to better give guidance on a number of issues which affect accounting standards. Component 3:Academic and Professional Education and Training(KICPAA)   The component will dwell on working with Universities to improve curricula for their Diploma and accounting Degrees to accord with modern accounting precepts and theory to catapult them into the profession. It will focus the efforts of firms and practitioners onto providing meaningful theoretical and practical training to the staff.

Specifically support: 1. Capacitating the University of Zambia, Department of Health Economics, and the Central Statistical Office in the Ministry of Finance and National Planning to carry out periodic data-gathering and analysis of the public expenditures on HIV/AIDS public sector, private sector including NGOs and to develop the appropriate instruments and methods for this purpose. The proposal will also pick back on the capacity that was built in the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Central Statistical Office (CSO) through the IDF grant to the health sector for PET to support the training. 2. Developing an advocacy strategy that will outline the importance of  periodic tracking of HIV/AIDS expenditures to improve budget execution accountability, transparency among development partners (donors), the private sector, NGOs local authorities, and consumers/patients, and to sharpen the sector\\'s results orientation by focusing on the service and coverage impact of available resources; and 3. Developing a roadmap for institutionalization of PETS through the existing public expenditure tracking systems. 4. Using the results from the HIV/AIDS public expenditure tracking survey, inform the formulation of relevant HIV/AIDS policies, strategies and programs and improve coordination and governance of resources in the public and private sectors, the NGOs and other Civil Society Organizations. The grant will strengthen the capacity for Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) and partners for tracking expenditure, particularly HIV/AIDS related public expenditure and assist in developing a mechanism for tracking expenditures within the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MOFNP), Central Statistical Office (CSO) and University of Zambia (UNZA), Health Economics Department (HED). </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2009-10-16\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2009-10-16\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2013-04-16\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2013-08-20\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Ms Musonda Rosemary Sunkutu</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior PHN Specialist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC -

This would be achieved through the following components: (i) strengthening legislation and other regulatory tools for implementation of the National Environmental Protection Act of 2007; (ii) improving regulatory tools for implementation of Environmental assessment Act of 2000; (iii) improving capacity and skills for decentralization of environmental clearance, enforcement and monitoring; and (iv) improving public participation in the environmental assessment and review process. The results will be measured by the following outcomes: # increase in number of new and revised regulations for improving the management of environmental impacts of development # increase in number of new and revised guidelines, codes of environmental practice and standards for addressing environmental impacts of development #increase in number of in-country trainers and trained persons for environmental assessment review, approval, enforcement and monitoring #enhanced public participation in the environmental assessment process The specific development objective of the Grant is to strengthen institutional capacity for implementation of environmental safeguards in Bhutan. This would be done through (i) development of regulations for implementation of the National Environmental Protection Act of 2007; (ii) revision of  environmental codes of practices and guidelines and development of new codes of practice for emerging sectors to facilitate implementation of Environmental Assessment Act of 2000; (iii) Improving capacity and skills for decentralization of environmental clearance, enforcement and monitoring and training of in-country trainers; and (iv) enhancing public participation in the environmental assessment and review process.  The results would be measured by the following outcomes:  # Increase in number of new and revised regulations for improving the management of environmental impacts of development activities impacts in key development sectors  # Increase in number of in-country trainers and trained personnel for environmental assessment review, approval, enforcement and # at least 20% of environmental assessments conducted have adequate public participation  The Grant will assist the Royal Government of Bhutan to enhance its policies, legislation, human resource capacity and skills, knowledge and public participation in improving its environmental safeguard system. In this way, it is expected that national policies, institutions and capacities for environmental assessment implementation, oversight, enforcement and monitoring will be enhanced to international standards.

A task force comprised of one representative from each Member State has been formed to draft a concept paper on \"Internal Control and Internal Audit Standards\" that could subsequently be implemented by each member country.  The same task force is to prepare a concept paper on accrediting public financial managers.  The grant will provide consulting services and financing for the task force in order to facilitate preparation and adoption of concept papers related to internal audit.  Possible future concept papers such as on accrual accounting and on accredited government accountants will be deferred in order to focus scarce resources on the immediate need to strengthen government internal audit in South Asia. Outcome: Standards to which government internal auditors in South Asia agree to be held accountable will be established and accepted. 1.1   Draft a concept paper on \"Internal Control and Internal Audit Standards\" Consider the relevance and applicability of the standards promulgated by the Institute of Internal Auditors in relation to public sector settings in South Asia.  Prepare implementation guidelines necessary to apply the international standards in South Asia. Circulate among member countries for comment.  Conduct seminars with relevant stakeholders from member countries to obtain initial feedback.  Agree on next steps. Output: A concept paper, endorsed and accepted by AGAOA, on \"Internal Control and Internal Audit Standards\" 1.2   Draft a concept paper on \"Certified Government Internal Auditors\" Compare training courses for government internal auditors supplied by training institutions in South Asia to those supplied by the Institute of Internal Auditors to identify gaps between regional and international practices.  Assess the adequacy or otherwise of best practices in training government internal auditors in light of the training needs of government internal auditors in South Asia to meet the standards defined in activity 1.1. Output: A defined body of learning including the classroom and practical work experience required to be considered by AGAOA to be \"certified\" as a qualified government internal auditor. 2.0   Sharing regional experiences and knowledge AGAOA members have expressed a need to continue the \"Experience Sharing Programs\" conducted since the formation of the Association in 2004.  The grant will support the sharing of best practices in internal audit, specifically in respect of training programs for internal auditors and through establishment of a community of practice for internal auditors in South Asia. Outcome: Government internal auditors in South Asia will be aware of and adopt best practices in government internal audit. 2.1   Build the capacity of training institutions in AGAOA member countries to deliver internal audit training courses Based on the results of activity 1.2, identify best practices in government internal audit training curricula, reading materials, case studies, lecture notes and teaching aids.  Disseminate at regional train the trainer courses.  Identify opportunities for visiting lecturers, collaborating with local chapters of IIA, or other ways to bolster the effectiveness of government internal audit training institutions. Output: Consistent competence (trained trainers, courses) to deliver training in government internal audit. 2.2   Establish a community of practice for government internal auditors in South Asia Establish a listserve comprised initially of AGAOA members but eventually including government internal audit practitioners, SAIs, donors and other interested persons in South Asia and from other regions of the world, to share best practices and internal audit transformation success stories, and to provide a link to peers with similar experiences.  Consider slightly revising the recent decision to publish an AGAOA Newsletter to instead include such news on an upgraded website to reach a wider audience. Outputs: Community of Practice, upgraded AGAOA website The objectives of the grant are:  1.  To upgrade the capacity in South Asia to supply professionally accredited internal auditors through the development of upgraded training courses and qualified trainers in internal audit.  2.  To share and adopt best practices in internal auditing through the benchmarking of internal control and internal auditing in South Asia to international best practices and through the establishment of a South Asian community of practice for internal auditors. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2009-12-15\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2009-12-15\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2013-07-15\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2013-06-25\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Leslie Isao Kojima</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Financial Management Specialist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email/>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC -

Financed Components, Activities and Outcomes 1.0   Enhance the capacity of the committee secretariat An effective secretariat can greatly enhance the effectiveness of committee meetings, through screening of audit reports, suggesting a prioritized annual work plan, suggesting agendas for meetings, scheduling witnesses, arranging for expert submissions and testimonies, preparing briefing materials for members, following up on committee recommendations, and of course maintaining the minutes and publicizing the results of committee proceedings.  At present, the committee secretariat does not carry out all of these functions.  A consultant with experience in Parliamentary oversight committee secretariats shall be engaged to provide technical assistance in enhancing the capacity of the committee secretariat. Outcome: Effectively functioning committee secretariat. 1.1   Assess current committee secretariat functions Compare committee secretariat practices to best practices in other jurisdictions and develop recommendations and priorities to enhance the functioning of the committee secretariat. Output: Diagnostic assessment of committee secretariat functions 1.2   Devise and apply new methodologies and procedures for committee secretariat staff Devise new procedures for screening audit reports, establishing work plans for the legislative session, and otherwise providing for more effective committee meetings.  Field test and provide on-the-job training in the application of the new procedures and document in a manual. Output: Committee secretariat procedures manual, trained secretariat staff 1.3   Develop committee secretariat ability to orient new committee members Develop orientation kits and presentations to assist the new Parliamentary oversight committee members following the formation of a new legislature in 2010.  Revise kits and orientation procedures based on experience in 2010. Output: Orientation kits for new Parliamentary oversight committee members 1.4   Share experiences with other Parliamentary oversight committee secretariats Network with peers in other jurisdictions through a legislative oversight community of practice.  Conduct meetings by VC and face to face. Output: Secretariat staff aware of regional best practices in legislative oversight. 2.0   Enhance the capacity of committee members Committee chairs determine the matters that will be discussed by the committee, and thus whether the committee will spend its time addressing trivial matters or issues of greater significance.  Committee members who do not fully appreciate the importance of Parliamentary oversight may be less inclined to attend meetings.  With 31 members each, the oversight committees may be unwieldy. All of these issues will be addressed by activities under this component of the project. Outcome: COPE and COPA members will attend and conduct more substantive committee meetings. 2.1   Conduct training for COPE and COPA members Provide training on the role of Parliamentary oversight committees and global best practices, with a view to developing priorities for improving committee effectiveness in Sri Lanka.  Introduce COPE and COPA members to the legislative oversight community of practice in order that they may exchange experiences with their peers. Outputs: Action plan setting out target achievements by Parliamentary oversight committees.

The project intends to support  the further elaboration and implementation of the MinTED\\'s institutional development strategy. Specifically, the activities under the project will aim to strengthen the Strategic Planning and Human Resource Management processes at the MinTED, to develop monitoring and evaluation systems to support policy formulation and decision-making at the ministry level, to develop and introduce performance appraisal system, and to strengthen policy analysis capacity through support for MinTED staff\\'s skill enhancement, including targeted training of the staff in econometrics, CGE modeling and application, and through conducting a survey of economic agents, to strengthen MinTED\\'s public relations and its engagement with civil society. TF092478 The development objective of this project is to build capacity at the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development through introducing new and innovative practices into their internal processes and piloting advanced models of policy making. The Ministry is responsible for private sector development agenda including tax policy optimization for further improvement in the business environment. This project brings policy analysis aspects in Armenia closer to international sound practice by providing technical assistance to build up institutional capacity in the Policy Formulation Divisions of the MinTED. This grant will finance activities through engaging international consultants for the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development (MinTED) of Armenia with the goal of building institutional capacity within the ministry. Such a goal will be pursued through supporting the further elaboration and implementation of the MinTED\\'s institutional development strategy and strengthening policy analysis capacity. Specifically, the activities under the project will strengthen the strategic planning and human resource management processes at the MinTED, develop monitoring and evaluation systems to support policy formulation and decision-making at the ministry level, develop and introduce performance appraisal system (note: MinTED is the pilot ministry out of 40 agencies in the civil service system where the performance appraisal system should be applied according to PRSC and PSMP targets), strengthen policy analysis capacity through support for MinTED staff\\'s skill enhancement, including targeted training of the staff with economic and econometric background on Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modeling and application, and through conducting a survey of economic agents, strengthen MinTED\\'s public relations and its engagement with civil society.  Such assistance will help the MinTED, responsible for observing and planning country wide and multi-sector systemic reforms (in various areas including tax policy) to prepare and implement a medium-term formal policy strategy taking into consideration CGE and econometric modeling and analysis as well as the authorities\\' plan to promote the development of a monitoring and evaluation systems. In addition, the project aims at fostering sustainable private sector development, mainly through the reform of tax policy framework and improved business environment. This can be measured by effective implementation of revised policies and tested by annual business survey showing private sector#s perception about cost of doing business in Armenia.  The rationale for this project relates to implementation of the second generation of policy reforms. These events will likely require improved public policy formulation and broadening the choices for provision of high quality public services amid significant challenges and opportunities for private sector expansion in Armenia. </narrative>\\n\\t   </description><participating-org ref=\"44000\" type=\"40\" role=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </narrative>\\n       </participating-org><participating-org ref=\"TF022120\" type=\"40\" role=\"4\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF) </narrative>\\n       </participating-org> <activity-status code=\"3\"/><activity-date type=\"1\" iso-date=\"2008-10-28\"/><activity-date type=\"2\" iso-date=\"2008-10-28\"/><activity-date type=\"3\" iso-date=\"2012-04-28\"/><activity-date type=\"4\" iso-date=\"2012-03-02\"/> <contact-info type=\"2\">\\n       <organisation>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </organisation>\\n       <department>\\n       <narrative/>\\n       </department>\\n       <person-name>\\n       <narrative>Mr Karen Grigorian</narrative>\\n       </person-name>\\n       <job-title>\\n       <narrative>Senior Private Sector Specialist</narrative>\\n       </job-title>\\n       <telephone>1202-458-7916</telephone>\\n       <email>kgrigorian@worldbank.org</email>\\n       <mailing-address>\\n       <narrative>1818 H St, NW, Washington DC - 22036</narrative>\\n       </mailing-address>\\n       </contact-info><activity-scope code=\"4\"/>  <recipient-country code=\"AM\">     <narrative>ARMENIA</narrative>\\n       </recipient-country> <sector code=\"32120\" vocabulary=\"1\" percentage=\"100.00\">\\n       <narrative>+![cdata[Industrial development]]+</narrative>\\n       </sector><collaboration-type code=\"2\"/>\\n       <default-aid-type code=\"C01\"/>\\n       <default-tied-status code=\"5\"/><budget type=\"1\">\\n       <period-start iso-date=\"2008-10-28\"/> \\n       <period-end iso-date=\"2012-04-28\"> </period-end>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">387360.06 </value>\\n       </budget><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"11\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">387360.06  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Incoming Commitment (Total Grant Allocated Amount) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description> \\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\">\\n       <narrative>Institutional Development Fund (IDF)</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"P111283\">\\n       <narrative>ARMENIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><transaction>\\n\\t  <transaction-type code=\"3\"/>\\n       <transaction-date iso-date=\"2020-06-30\"/>\\n       <value currency=\"USD\" value-date=\"2024-05-31\">387360.06  </value>\\n\\t\\t   <description>\\n       <narrative>Disbursement(Total Recipient-Executed Trust Funds Disbursements ) - as of June 30th, 2020</narrative> \\n       </description>\\n\\t    <provider-org provider-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </provider-org>\\n       <receiver-org receiver-activity-id=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-P111283\">\\n       <narrative>ARMENIA</narrative>\\n       </receiver-org>\\n       <finance-type code=\"110\"/>\\n       </transaction><related-activity ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF-TF022120\" type=\"1\"/></iati-activity><iati-activity last-updated-datetime=\"2024-06-13T17:41:51\" xml:lang=\"EN\" default-currency=\"USD\" hierarchy=\"02\">\\n       <iati-identifier>XI-IATI-WBTF-P111310</iati-identifier>\\n       <reporting-org ref=\"XI-IATI-WBTF\" type=\"40\">\\n       <narrative>World Bank Trust Funds</narrative>\\n       </reporting-org>\\n       <title>\\n       <narrative>Improving Management over Special Purpose Transfer Payment in China</narrative>\\n       </title>\\n       <description type=\"1\">\\n       <narrative>The overall development objective of the proposed IDF is to support the enhancement of transparency, effectiveness and efficiency of budget execution of special purpose transfer payment (SPTP) in China.
